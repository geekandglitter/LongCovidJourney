	<br>This is a simple crawler that crawls the entire recipe blog periodically. It then stores the results in the
	model. The new faster search at the top of this page searches the model rather than the actual pages on my blog. This 
	is called an index search, and it's a lot faster than a rifle search. An index search is how google works. This view
	 relies on the recipes retrieved in the above view.</small></li>
