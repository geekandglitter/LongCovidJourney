Let\'s go easy on ourselves and let\'s not quibble. The big picture is that the Western diet is around 16 to 1.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; font-family: arial; white-space: pre-wrap;">Omega-6\'s are inflammatory. Omega-3\'s are anit-inflammatory. Inflammation is important to the body; that\'s why we need some omega-6 fatty acids. But not 16 to 1, and that\'s the cause of many illnesses.</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; white-space: pre-wrap;">An easy tweak: aim for a good ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids. This can be done on any decent diet, from vegan all the way to carnivore.</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; white-space: pre-wrap;">\n\nI believe that aiming for a good ratio is part of getting well.\n\nBut what\'s causing this out of whack ratio? Our animals are fed the wrong foods. They\'re fed foods that are too high in Omega-6 and not high enough in Omega-3. This translates into us eating beef, pork, chicken, fish, eggs and dairy that have this imbalance.\n<br /></span></span></div><div><span style="color: #050505; font-family: arial; white-space-collapse: preserve;">It can make a huge difference to be a little Omega-minded when we choose our food. </span><span style="color: #050505; font-family: arial; white-space-collapse: preserve;"> </span></div><div><span style="color: #050505; font-family: arial; white-space-collapse: preserve;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And if you\'re a vegan, just make sure you\'re getting the right ratio.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><br /><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><br /></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><br /></span><div><span style="font-family: arial;">If you know anyone suffering from Long Haul Covid (aka PASC) or they\'re not sure, or are a caregiver of a PASC patient, here\'s a crowdsourcing site they might want to join: <a href="https://www.stuffthatworks.health/long-term-effects-of-covid-19/join?token=Q8JF16UL" target="_blank">Stuffthatworks</a></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: arial;"> Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

The Structural integrity in buidlings and bridges is carefully inspected by engineers on a regular basis. That\'s what keeps us safe. But some high places are inaccessible or dangerous for engineers to inspect. Historically, those places have gotten little to no attention, sometimes with disastrous results of injury and death.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">But at last, there\'s a solution -- drones are now doing that inspection.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Likewise, our GI tracts can be carefully inspected -- a colonoscopy inspects the lower area, and the endoscopy inspects the higher portion. The part in between -- the small intestinves have largely been ignored.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestines is known to be the cause of multiple illnesses, because of autopsies, but it\'s still hard to detect in living humans.

She cited "low blood volume" but she has now added that she doesn\'t know why the phlebotomy, all other conditions considered, would have been the cause.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Moreover, from my research, I found out the fainting could well have been caused by Delta-8 gummies. Which is bad news because we thought the switch from Delta-8 on weekends to Delta-8 nightly was doing something good. And that was the other post I delayed until today, paired with this one.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And to add even more fuel to the fire, I just learned today that our state\'s laws are now in question about allowing us to get our gummies. If our state stops selling it, we would have to cross the border or start over again and find a doctor in our state so we could get a prescription. <br /><br />Our very excellent doctor is across that border, and he can\'t prescribe for us. This change is bad news for a few reasons, not the least of which is that we\'re exhausted all the time.<br /><br />I\'ve stopped asking "when do we get a break?" I already know it\'s an unreasonable and frustrating question to ask.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">So I continue to pound the pavement.&nbsp;</span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s quite possible the combination of Delta-8 plus the phlebotomy, plus "looking up" all contributed. (Yup--we are International Space Station Watchers, and were at his office window, looking up. That\'s why he didn\'t hit his head -- I was right there and I caught him.)<br /><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">But now we need to step up the pace to find another solution so we\'re not solely relying on the Delta-8. Yes of course, Delta-9 is an alternative. That will be part of the research.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We have many roads to go down; there\'s never a break, including that it\'s time to look into LDN, which could be a big gun, as it can target the sleep issues <b>and</b> the very stubborn fatigue. Imagine that -- two symptoms at once! (Please read sarcasm in this.) Hopefully LDN doesn\'t cause fainting.<br /><br />And&nbsp;even though we just ruled out POTS, we need to do another POTS assessment because POTS is associated with low blood volume. Low blood volume can cause fainting.</span></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />Chasing after Long Covid answers is like a dog chasing its tail.&nbsp; I hate to think what happens when that tail gets caught.

And again, it doesn\'t mean he\'s "getting better."<br /><br />What it does mean is we might have found a consistent attack for one of his over a dozen symptoms. It\'s another masking of symptoms, but this is a quality of life issue while we waiting for the researchers to figure out PASC.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We wanted to address the chronic problem of "unrefreshed sleep regardless of hours slept."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We\'ve been through months of experiments for this.</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /><br />And when we resorted to cannabinoids, we tried CBD first. It did nothing. Only THC has shown any improvement. And that\'s earth-shattering.&nbsp;<br /></span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, we discovered THC Delta-8 gummies as a remedy many months ago. It eliminated the depression and sometimes provided a refreshed sleep. But only when he used it. We\'d been restricting his use to weekends.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if he took his gummies early in the eventing, the high effect lasted too far into the next day for him to feel he would be able to work. As a reminder, he works two to three hours a day.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And so, all this time on work days, he was working slowly and not terribly happy because of no THC the night before.<br /><br />Then when other factors pointed in this direction about a month ago, we looked again at the two options of his condition while working. And we decided to take the plunge.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Now that he\'s using the THC every night, he is working at the same slow pace as he was working before. Not slower, not faster. It\'s the same, except he\'s happier.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Green bars mean refreshed sleep. A darker color means he had to wake up to his alarm. So he\'s now had five refreshed sleep days in a row. He has broken his previous record of four.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s still in Phase 1, which is only about treating symptoms, and we\'re not yet declaring success at treating this one symptom with THC, but we are certainly able to declare definitively that\'s he\'s broken a record.</span></div><div><br /><hr /><div><span style="font-family: arial;">If you know anyone suffering from Long Haul Covid (aka PASC) or they\'re not sure, or are a caregiver of a PASC patient, here\'s a crowdsourcing site they might want to join: </span><a href="https://www.stuffthatworks.health/long-term-effects-of-covid-19/join?token=Q8JF16UL" style="font-family: arial;" target="_blank">Stuffthatworks</a></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: arial;"> Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

When we are finding ourselves constantly "checking in" to see how we\'re doing. \n\nI think maybe there\'s a threshold past which we can, indeed, make ourselves worse by all this checking in. This gets into the realm of neuroplasticity and retraining the brain -- words which are used more often in the realm of functional medicine than in conventional medicine.\n\nBut here\'s the kicker -- it\'s not black and white by any means. Becoming self-aware of what\'s triggering us can help us figure out what\'s making us better. Some symptoms are treatable or at least, maskable.\n\n</span></span></span></div></div><div class="x1e56ztr" data-block="true" data-editor="4dtel" data-offset-key="cuk7s-0-0" style="background-color: white; color: #050505; margin-bottom: 8px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="cuk7s-0-0" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;"><span data-offset-key="cuk7s-0-0">Interestingly, some symptoms of ME/CFS, which intersects with Long Covid, are likely to resolve on their own, in their own time, and we don\'t want to be so focussed on them that we prolong them.  \n\nI\'ve met people in my FB group and on </span><span class="xv78j7m" data-offset-key="cuk7s-1-0" end="249" spellcheck="false" start="235" style="background-color: var(--text-highlight);">Survivor Corps FB group</span><span data-offset-key="cuk7s-2-0"> who have gotten better with brain retraining. There\'s no question in my mind as to why it works. (And no, it\'s not all in your imagination. It\'s quite real that we can accidentally send our brain down false paths that can become well-worn.)\n\nFor a while, I was wondering where the line is drawn between self-awareness and this harmful hyper-awareness, but I\'ve had my question answered for now by something one of my members said here which jumped out at me.</span></span></div></div><div class="x1e56ztr" data-block="true" data-editor="4dtel" data-offset-key="bc9mv-0-0" style="background-color: white; color: #050505; margin-bottom: 8px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="bc9mv-0-0" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;"><span data-offset-key="bc9mv-0-0">They mentioned some remedies that helped, but then they said this: "...other than that, it\'s just been time and </span><span data-offset-key="bc9mv-0-1" style="font-weight: bold;">trying not to care</span><span data-offset-key="bc9mv-0-2">."\n\nOne more thing -- I ran this new revelation by my husband, and he said that\'s a big part of what he\'s doing every day -- he reports his symptoms to me (so I can go off and research) and then he spends the rest of his day not thinking about his illness. I strongly believe in that for him. Maybe it applies to someone else here too. We\'re all different in this, but maybe this will help someone.\n\nI\'ve long said "denial is underrated." LOL. To some degree, perhaps that applies here.

We\'ll tell you when we think he has started "getting better."</span></span></div></div><div class="x1e56ztr" data-block="true" data-editor="1irgn" data-offset-key="dcfqj-0-0" style="background-color: white; color: #050505; margin-bottom: 8px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="dcfqj-0-0" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"><span data-offset-key="dcfqj-0-0"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">In his illness for the last fourteen months, what he does get is a bit of variation from one day to next in which symptoms are high and which symptoms are lower.  He has spikes, it\'s largely unpredictable, and the fatigue never drops.\n\nSince last summer, he has also had an overall slightly lowered incidence of a few of the neuropsychiatric symptoms (which is a subset of all his symptoms) and the reason for the slightly lowered incidence of those few is because we are masking them with psychotropic medications. Masking is not recovering but it helps make life more liveable.\n\nIn the meantime, we\'ve trying other strategies in the hopes of lowering various symptoms or at least quelling those spikes.  We ultimately want to kick-start an actual recovery, but that might have to happen on its own, as we now know from at least one study that ME/CFS, when caused by the Covid-19 virus specifically, can resolve in some sufferers (unlike the ME/CFS symptoms caused by other viruses.)\n \nIf you understand basic probability, and consider that much of what he\'s experiencing is essentially random, it\'s not a shock that he could have a day in which almost all the symptoms are at their best (not gone but best) on the same day.\n\nIt happened today. Let me make it clear we are far from believing that he\'s turning the corner toward actual recovery. Rather, this is a probability event. \n\nThe miracle of it is that it happens to coincide with a plan he had for today that was ridiculous for him to try and do, but we made that decision judiciously, as it would be too much of a hit to his mental health to skip it. \n\nWe knew there was an excellent chance he would have to force his way through today and be a wreck. It has happened before, so trust this: there is no correlation between his plan to do something "normal" today and his planetary lineup.\n\nI have a background in math, I understand statistics and probability, I graph his correlations, and I also understand when good stuff happens by the grace of the universe. They all co-exist, and every day, I am discerning the differences. Until I see more correlations, today is an anomaly in terms of his illness but also a gift from above.</span></span></div></div><div class="x1e56ztr" data-block="true" data-editor="1irgn" data-offset-key="du1cv-0-0" style="background-color: white; color: #050505; margin-bottom: 8px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="du1cv-0-0" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"><span data-offset-key="du1cv-0-0"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">And so, off he went to his big annual event. And just for today, I have a spring in my step. I take what I can get.\n\nCautiously, I\'ll add this -- one or two of those symptoms could have been mitigated by a change we just made this week in one of his treatments, but certainly not all the symptoms are quelled by that one adjustment. And it\'s too early to tell whether there\'s any correlation at all.</span></span></div></div><div class="x1e56ztr" data-block="true" data-editor="1irgn" data-offset-key="b6gs5-0-0" style="background-color: white; color: #050505; margin-bottom: 8px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="b6gs5-0-0" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"><span data-offset-key="b6gs5-0-0"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">Mike\'s condition today is what\'s known formally in the field of probability as a "rare event" or in statistics, an "outlier." \n\nIt\'s still not a truly good day, either, as his fatigue level is as high as it always is.  He has to be careful to pace himself today, as always. But the upside is he\'s going to be with friends, and  will be able to have ffffffffun because of this anomaly.\n\nI am certain that those of you familiar with this illness will understand what I just wrote. And those who intuitively understand statistics and probability can understand it too. And, lastly, those of you who apply themselves to believing me will also catch on to all the nuances.\n\nSo if you got all the way to the end, thank you. My report had to be this long, because to omit the nuanced details only leads to overgeneralizations and false conclusions. Us Long Covid survivors deal with overgeneralizations and false conclusions every day, and it\'s alienating.\n\nTo come up to the surface, there\'s a parallel here -- scientific discovery takes a long time. It\'s taking a long time in the world of Long Covid research, and it\'s taking a long time as it pertains specifically to my hubby.</span></span></div></div><hr /><div><span style="font-family: arial;">If you know anyone suffering from Long Haul Covid (aka PASC) or they\'re not sure, or are a caregiver of a PASC patient, here\'s a crowdsourcing site they might want to join: <a href="https://www.stuffthatworks.health/long-term-effects-of-covid-19/join?token=Q8JF16UL" target="_blank">Stuffthatworks</a></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><span> Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

I am then keeping a graph, as I\'ve done in the past for other correlation-seeking. My efforts have been largely futile until possibly now.</div><div><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: left;">At last, I may have found a connection!</h4>No, I still don\'t see a correlation in the graph, but I may have found a trigger, which wasn\'t getting reported daily and hasn\'t been in the graph.<br /><br />So now, we will have to go back into:<br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Anecdotal data, which we can find sporadically mentioned in our document</span></li><li>Past events in our google calendar</li><li>Any anecdotal data Mike may have been writing into his "Visible" phone app</li></ol></span><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The trigger could be EXERTION</span></h4><span style="font-family: arial;">We do know that social, cognitive, emotional and physical exertion can lead to Post Exertional Symptom Exacerbation. It\'s a mouthful, but its abbreviation is PESE. (It used to be called PEM.)</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Months ago, Mike has a big attack of PEM that lasted a few weeks. It was the result of trying to push through (because no doctor told us not to because no doctor was willing to diagnose the ME/CFS -- that\'s an egregious topic for another day, another post.)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s my theory</span></h4><div><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result of that weeks-long PESE episode, Mike knows how to pace himself now. However, there are more minor exertions that could be leading to his sleep onset delay. After all, exertion isn\'t black and white.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">The problem could be accumulation of small exertions, or it could be just one type of exertion. I don\'t know. I would theorize that physical exertion is the least of the culprits.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the resulting symptom? Maybe the SLEEP ONSET DELAY</span></h4><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I think it could be that his days of a little more exertion, while not leading to the very extreme PESE he had many months ago, could be leading to just one symptom -- his sleep onset delay.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Alternatively, the resulting symptom could be the "waking unrefreshed." Happily, we are measuring all the energy symptoms already. <br /><br />Moving forward, I think I want to write down each day some way of quantifying his exertion of the day before (and its type) so it\'s all in one place.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In the meantime, the project ahead of me is to scrape up past exertions, and figuring out how to quantify them.<br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________<br /><br /> Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

The short answer is do whatever you can to get help. Here are some thoughts, based on our own experience and that of others.</span></div><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="b24fk-0-0" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"><span data-offset-key="b24fk-0-0" style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="b24fk-0-0" style="direction: ltr; position: relative;"><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Gather a few medical terms related to your condition. A few examples of terms that could get your doctor\'s attention:\n\n</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Say PASC instead of Long Covid</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Tell your doctor there\'s a diagnosis code for PASC</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Use the term "neuropsychiatric symptoms" or neuro-PASC</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Keep in mind, doctors are not researchers. They are waiting for the research just as we are. It\'s okay to inform your doctor! (Find gentle ways to do so while protecting their egos.)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If you have symptoms of ME/CFS, which is likely, tell your doctor you seem to have a number of symptoms "consistent with" ME/CFS (which used to be called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.) Doctors like the term "consistent with." </span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If your symptoms flair after exertion, use the term PESE (which stands for Post Exertional Symptom Exacerbation.) You will likely be ahead of your doctor on this newer term -- your doctor might know it as PEM (Post Exertional Malaise.) </span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Directly ask your doctor if they could do some research for you; for example, to see if they can find a clinical trial you can participate in. Such a request will help prompt your doctor to learn about this condition, even if the outcome is they can\'t find a clinical trial. In other words, find ways to prompt them to want to learn.\n\n</span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Get used to the idea that for now, you need to treat symptoms. Relief is not the same as recovery, but it can really help while waiting. And accept the fact that you may need multiple specialists to treat your symptoms. There is no one doctor for "Long Covid."\n\n</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If at all possible, do visit a "Long Covid Clinic" sometimes called a "Post Covid Clinic" or PCC. The reason? Your answers to their questions will contribute to the ongoing research. Your data can help find your cure! Get on the waiting list now; these clinics are busy.\n\n</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Find an easy, comfortable way to document for yourself your different symptoms each day, and use whatever kind of scale works for you, to rate the severity of each one. For example, what level is your fatigue today on a scale of 0 to 100? How much dizziness did you have yesterday? It doesn\'t have to be fancy -- you can do this in a journal with a pen. Over time, you might see fluctuations, and be able to track whether your remedies are working.\n\n</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Use your own journaling to help you distinguish between symptoms which you might not otherwise realize are separate. For example, a sleep disorder and fatigue are different. It\'s possible to have a good night\'s sleep and still have fatigue in the morning. That way, you can notice which remedies are working for what. And then you can tell your doctor "I have sleep onset delay and I have fatigue." This kind of specifics will make more of an impression than "I\'m tired all the time."\n\n</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Be open, if possible, to conventional medication for depression, anxiety, psychosis, and other mental health conditions, keeping in mind that these symptoms are caused directly by the virus -- it\'s not all in your head. There are many tried and trusted medications already in existence that can give you the relief you need to at least function, and maybe think cleary and become a better self-advocate.\n\n</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Ask your physician to please look into the existing genetic tests that will help guide decision-making about trying medication. If they push back, insist that this is too serious to be ruling out tests not currently covered by insurance. These tests help individualize recommendations for medications to try.\n\n</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If you\'re easily intimidated by physicians, you might need to get outside your comfort zone a little bit. Maybe <a href="https://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/12/12-27-stop-all-medical-intimidation.html" target="_blank">this article</a> I wrote recently will help.</span></li></ol><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">* Note: These are my personal musings, based on my immersion into the PASC world for the last thirteen months. </span></div></div></div><hr /><span style="font-family: arial;"><big>  Join my&nbsp;\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a>&nbsp;Facebook group.

During the course of those fourteen months, we learned that this is a manage-only illness.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;"><b>There\'s a big difference between recovering and managing.&nbsp;</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Happily, now we\'ve seen one study suggesting it\'s actually possible for real recovery to begin at some point. But that recovery hasn\'t started yet.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We\'ve had his illness under a microscope, we are doing our research, and we\'re staying out ahead of it.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Thus we will know best when it starts to resolve. We\'ll tell you! And when it starts to resolve, recovery might be slow -- maybe another year or two.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In addition, because of possible permanent neurological damage done, and possible irreversible effects from meds taken for symptom management, he might be more of a new Mike than the old Mike.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Moreover, when that recovery begins, we will need to revisit all his symptom meds, on which he\'s finally stabilized, and shake them up again. That project will take about six months.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">There\'s nothing like an invisible chronic illness to cause one to think again about social connections. As I\'ve said often, we are so grateful for our inner circle.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">You are those who respect our wishes.

For example, patients who\'ve had Epstein-Barr (caused by mononucleosis) can develop ME/CFS.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Patients diagnosed with ME/CFS learn that there is no cure, and that they will spend the rest of their lives managing symptoms with meds and therapies. And they learn to adjust to their new limitations.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">That\'s the road we\'re on. But there\'s a new study that shows one critical difference&nbsp;between pre-Covid and post-Covid ME/CFS. While patients who developed ME/CFS before the pandemic don\'t ever begin real recovery (they only manage their symptoms for a lifetime), patients whose ME/CFS is caused by Long Haul Covid, do eventually start real recovery.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">This is potentially earth-shattering news for us personally, and for all our friends in cyberspace, many of whom have not even been getting the symptom treatment they need. But understandably, more studies are needed.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike is still managing symptoms; there has been no real recovery. But we\'re encouraged. It could begin to resolve at some point. And we will know the difference between symptom-management and the start of real reocvery, as we have this journey under a microscope.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And what that will mean is, once the Long Covid starts to really resolve itself, is we will be slowly managing his meds -- reducing some, replacing some, maybe eliminating some.

This post is Part Two. If you read Part One, you\'ll understand why it\'s time for us to take another shot at our Covid safety guidelines.</div><div><br /></div></span><div><span style="font-family: arial;">These new guidelines are a mix of risk/reward ratio, our trust in others, and our mental health.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">There are obviously shades of gray, but to simplify, we can outline three criteria for our travel and visiting decisions:</span><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Trust in Attitudes:</b>&nbsp;<br />We\'re willing to be around people whom we trust to:<br /></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Respect this pandemic</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Take Long Covid seriously</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Respect chronic disability</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Be willing to meet the needs of the most vulnerable group member</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Believe us<br /></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Trust in Distancing, Masks, and Rules:</b>&nbsp;<br />This allows us to do some amount of engaging one of our greatest joys, which is galavanting around NYC:<br /></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">When on mass transit, we distance and wear masks</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">When outside in NYC, we distance and sometimes wear masks</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">When considering entering inside in NYC, we check on rules and crowdedness, and we do masks and distancing<br /></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Ready access to Paxlovid is our security blanket:</b>&nbsp;<br />In the worst case scenario, we know we have quick easy access to Paxlovid or other treatments. Because treatments and providers are still in flux, we\'ve nailed down for ourselves a list of all contacts of whom we will ask this question: "What\'s the fastest way for us to get the best treatment?" That list is sitting where we can see it. <br /><br />This third option allows us to not have to completely isolate.</span></li></ol><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why attitudes matter</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Our decisions have led to some disappointments, but that\'s life.&nbsp; We\'ve had to close in our circle a little more. That change, we\'ve learned, is not uncommon to people we\'ve met who have Long Covid.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">The upshot is we\'ve had to make some further changes in our lifestyle. This includes less tolerance of ableist attitudes.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">For almost thirty-one years, we\'ve seen precious few abelist attitudes toward our disabled son. Yet in the last year, we\'ve seen ample ableist attitudes toward Long Covid. The difference may have to do with both visibilty and current understanding of the disability. <br /><br />In our son\'s case, his disability shows clearly on his face, and is well understood. In contrast, Mike\'s Long Covid is largely invisible, and is new to the medical community and the community at large.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Abelist attitudes directed right to our faces, such as "I don\'t worry about Covid-19" have no place in our mental health.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We also have no room for folks who think they know better than we do about Mike\'s condition, treatment, meds, our choices, and my needs as Mike\'s caregiver and chief researcher.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Ultimately, no one can know how best we should pick our battles except us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We rely on the support from our wonderful family and friends in the form of bolstering, cheering, and open-minded interest. We are grateful for the support we have. It\'s making all the difference.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial;">"Truly I tell you,&nbsp;</span><b style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: Roboto, arial, sans-serif;">whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me</b><span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial;">" (Matthew 25:40, 45, NIV)</span></span></div></div></div><hr /><span style="font-family: arial;">Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

If it\'s hard for you, and you\'re a caregiver, here\'s some permissions, just for you:</span></div><div><ol><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s time for Opposite World. When you get advice, consider its opposite. That might work better. This reflects how opposite our illness is<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Stay home if that\'s what your wisdom tells you -- it can save you and your loved one from health complications, or worse<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Caregivers are limited in their exertions too. We need to follow Spoon Theory for ourselves. See my post about <a href="https://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/09/spoon-theory-for-caregivers.html" target="_blank">Spoon Theory for Caregivers</a><br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Expect to be misunderstood. Other people\'s opinions count less than ever before, and that could include that of loved ones. Few, if any, people will understand well enough to offer value<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">You might need a new tribe, even if only temporary. Your current tribe may not be equipped to support your emotional and physical needs. Better yet, find individuals<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Expect to be criticized -- you\'re either doing too much or not enough, either for yourself, or for your loved one. Laugh it off<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Recognize that you can\'t be spread very thin. Tell others what you can no longer do, and refrain from elaborating<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If you want a few people to understand, then keep them in the explanation loop. Keep in mind, though, that you have to spend spoons to do that<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Explanations only beg arguments or advice, so for the outside world, just tell them your limits and leave it at that. As caregivers, we don\'t have any mental space for explaining and defending ourselves. None<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Mental health is a personal thing. Reach always for your mental health, but what that looks like might not match conventional wisdom<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If someone questions your boundaries or your self-care, say "If I don\'t take care of myself, I\'ll burn out. Would you like to take over at that point?"&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Seek counself if you want, but trrust your own wisdom more than that of anyone else. You know the total picture better than anybody</span></li></ol></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">If you think of more to add to this list, let me know in a comment!</span><br /><hr /><span style="font-family: arial;">Join my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

The next step is they want him to see a cardiologist, bringing with him all the data they took. After that, he can return to physical therapy.<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>New Terms: </b>We\'ve learned the term "episodic symptoms" which describe Mike\'s journey. For example, he can be stable at a fatigue level of seventy, then suddenly he encounters sleep disruptions for a few days in a row, or he gets a series of migraines. Or he has an obligation that creates stress, thus intensifying his symptoms.<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Reinfections: </b>I\'ve met yet more Long Covid patients whose symptoms worsened after getting a reinfection of Covid-19, and for some, even a cold. A reinfection can cause a worsening of brain fog, depression and anxiety, opeing the door to migraines, nerve pain, paranoia and intrusive thoughts. In light of the commonality of this news, we\'ve had to go pretty extreme in keeping ourselves safe.<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Interactive fun: </b>This excellent article from NIH has a clickable diagram.

They can all can lead to&nbsp;Post-Exertional Symptom Exacerbation (PESE). Other forms of stress, such as deadlines or conflicts, also lead to PESE.<br /><br />Existing symptoms such as disabling fatigue or exhaustion, difficulty thinking, pain, exercise intolerance, and other symptoms are made worse by exertion.<br /><br /></span></li><li><b>Get reinfected with Covid-19</b>. A survey showed that reinfection overwhelmingly worsened the symptoms of Long COVID in most people who were still symptomatic.<br /><br />In those who still have Long COVID at the time of reinfection, 80% see their symptoms worsen, and 85% see old symptoms return or new additional symptoms emerge. <a href="https://www.longcovidkids.org/post/a-world-first-effect-of-covid-reinfection-on-people-living-with-long-covid" target="_blank">Click here</a> to find the survey (a downloadable pdf.)<br /><br /></li><li><b>Get a different virus, such as a cold</b>. Patients with Long Covid have reported exacerbation of their Long Covid symptoms after they get the common cold. <br /><br />It\'s possible an infection of other viruses such as Herpes and Epstein-Barr can also excacerbate the symptoms of Long Covid. <br /><br />But what we do know is Covid-19 virus&nbsp;can trigger reactivation of an existing, latent Herpes Virus or Epstein-Barr Virus.<br /><br />We also know that ME/CFS, which embodies the set of symptoms that half of all Long Covid patients develop, existed before Covid-19 did, and is known to be triggered by other viruses, including Herpes and Epstein-Barr.</li></ol><h3 style="text-align: left;">What to do to prevent Exacerbation</h3><div><br /></div><div>As you might have concluded, all three the above-described are forms of stress. So, reduce every kind of stress you can. Specifically:</div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Relentless self-pacing</b>. Limit social, physical, and emotional exertion each day. And if you can get more granular than that, do so. For example, you might need to limit upper body exertion more than limiting your walking.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Masking always</b>. Be counter-culture. Be counter-family. Even if everyone around you has tested negative for Covid-19, just so you can be included, one person with a cold can exacerbate your symptoms.</li></ol></div></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span><hr /><span style="font-family: arial;"><big><span style="font-size: medium;">  Join my&nbsp;\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a>&nbsp;Facebook group.

The reason is not because it\'s "all in their head."<br /><br />Rather, the reason is that Long Covid can include multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms. Because Long Covid has no cure, we need to treat each symptom. That can mean multiple specialists.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />A psychiatrist (or a psychiatric&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">nurse)</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;are the specialists who can prescribe those serious meds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">While all of us can probably benefit from therapy, especially to cope with the current changes in our lives, I\'m guessing there are Long Covid patients who can benefit well enough from the meds, without supplemental therapy.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Conventional wisdom says do both. But Long Covid forces us to pick our battles to an exponential degree. That fact sometimes redefines wisdom.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And now here\'s another wrinkle, and I draw no conclusions.

Without our mental health, we don\'t recover. So we must have support from those few who:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Believe us</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Understand that the world is full of misinformation about the illness</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Are willing to trust our research</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Can hear bad news as well as good</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Are on our side</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Can slow down to our pace of recovery</span></li></ol></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But that presents a problem</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Mixed groups are too painful to be around. Even one dismissive type can cause more distress than it\'s worth to be in that group</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So here\'s what we did and are doing</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We\'ve become relentless about forging existing and new individual relationships, both in person, and online:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Writing Mike\'s blog journey and sending out to a mailing list</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Running a Facebook group and participating in another Facebook group</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Meeting with individuals from church and family</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Staying in touch with loved ones who "get it"</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Finding new listening ears</span></li></ol><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Results</span></h3></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Individual members of our family, friends, and church are on board</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We periodically receive messages of prayer, love and concern, and we even received a prayer shawl!</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Our mental health is much better because of our carefully chosen support individuals</span>&nbsp;</li></ol><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But where to start?</span></h3></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Many Covid patients are not so lucky as us. They have no support at all, not even a siginifcant other to advocate for them. But adding one person to your camp is better than adding zero. Go slow.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And think outside the box. Your potential support individuals might not be who you think they should be. When I would go fishing as a kid, my dad used to say "the biggest fish are where you find them." So stay open-minded.</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>Instead of thinking in terms of your family or your place of worship, think in terms of one individual at a time.&nbsp;</span>You probably already have wisdom about which folks are better relegated to "fair weather friends."</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If you have one or two people on your side, let them know they are allowed and encouraged to spread around their knowledge, if they feel so inclined.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Professional help is good too. Therapists, psychiatrists, faith leaders, life coaches. It\'s not their title that counts. It\'s whether you see that they can march in your parade.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Join some online groups. This is a somehwat tricky area, as you might get a bit of negativity, but there\'s so much support on those groups that it could be worth it. And you can report trolls. The haters don\'t stick around long.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Remember to show interest in your support people. One-sided support isn\'t healthy.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">One more thought -- people burn out. It\'s human nature. So, finding new support from time to time can help you. Remember that our illness isn\'t easy to hear about.</span></li></ol></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s a <a href="https://solvecfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Loving-Someone-with-MECFS-or-Long-Covid.pdf" target="_blank">helpful read</a>, written both for the patient and their support.</span></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It takes courage, but that\'s a resource all of us can muster!</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter the severity of our symptoms, it is my opinion that courage resides in a remaining healthy place in our brains. Remember, courage is a decision that coexists with fear.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Wisdom is the joining of emotion and intellect. Use your wisdom to pick and choose, and be relentless.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But sometimes isolation is the better choice</span></h3><span style="font-family: arial;">I think it\'s safe to say that the majority of folks in our Long Covid community have no perseverence leftover. Thus, it starts to look like support is optional. I\'d say that\'s valid. It has to be. And yes, conventional wisdom needs to be a little flexible.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />And another reason not to try -- for many, any more rejection is intolerable and therefore unthinkable.</span><div><br /></div><hr /><span style="font-family: arial;">Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

There is no pattern to this.</span></div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">Additional symptoms that returned last night</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Jumpy, anxious, heartburn, nausea, dizzy, all preceded last night\'s migraine.</span></div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">What do we have control over?</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Because we can\'t find correlations, we have no control over new symptoms or old symptoms reappearing.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We do have control over preventing symptom exacerbation, also known as PESE (Post Exertional Symptom Exacerbation). That\'s prevented by non-stop mindful pacing, even on the "good" days. Mike is doing pacing beautifully.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">Now look at the graph again</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Looking at the graph, imagine other lines appearing in other colors on other days. Some days there are five; some days ten; some days more.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">If even one person replies to me by email, text, comment, phone, or carrier pigeon that you "get it now," I will be so happy.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I have to find my happiness in strange places.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So I\'m begging those who love Mike -- please accept that he is not on the mend. We understand it\'s not easy for anyone to accept. It\'s not easy for us to accept either. But to the extent that our loved ones can accept this, we would really appreciate it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And don\'t worry -- that won\'t stop us from receiving a miracle or a cure!</span></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span><hr /><span style="font-family: arial;">Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

This is a delay of two hours or more from a more conventional sleep onset time.</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium;">For many months now, Mike\'s sleep onset time has been 3 am or even later, regardless of multiple strategies.</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium;">Once we get a handle on the sleep onset delay, we will try to manage the also very stubborn fatigue, which has been with him for almost a year now -- the entirety of his PASC illness.</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium;">So here\'s what we\'ve done in the last few weeks:</div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large;">First, we adjusted the Luvox dosage</span></h1><div style="font-size: medium;">We raised the dosage which got mixed results:</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>His depression dropped<br /><b>but...</b></li><li>His sleep onset progress was impaired</li></ul></div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large;">So...we adjusted the Luvox timing</span></h1><div style="font-size: medium;">We switched the Luvox from night to morning, which caused:</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Improvement -- so far, two out of three nights are now good<br /><b>but...</b></li><li>We don\'t see a correlation to explain the unfavorable one out of three nights</li></ul></div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large;">So...we haven\'t yet adjusted the Wellbutrin</span></h1><div style="font-size: medium;">Wellbutrin is the medication that resolved his anxiety last spring. We now have in hand a higher dose to address the fatigue, but not just yet...we want to take one adjustment at a time so we can keep track, find correlations, and manage side effects.</div><div style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: medium;">But that doesn\'t mean his sleep onset needs to be totally resolved. The current pattern of two good nights out of three might or might not improve further.</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium;">We\'ll just give it a little more time for the sleep pattern to either improve or stabilize. Mike will know when the time is right because, as he says, "I\'ll know it when I see it."</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: medium;">Increasing the Wellbutrin should lead to:&nbsp;</div><div style="font-size: medium;"><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Lowered fatigue<br /><b>but...</b></li><li>It could cause a new interference with sleep</li></ul></div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large;">And what if the Wellbutrin interferes with sleep?</span></h1><div style="font-size: medium;">We have two ideas to manage that.

It is defined as a sleep pattern that is delayed two hours or more from a conventional sleep pattern, causing you to go to sleep later and wake up later. It is not easily solved by traditional strategies.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Mike has suffered for many months with this symptom, leading to waking each day in the afternoon. It\'s still too early to know for sure, but it\'s possible we\'re seeing some improvement.</div></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div>That is, he\'s had three out of four days so far of improved sleep onset, since switching the Luvox from night to morning. We now realize from our daily extensive notes that the sleep onset problem may have been just starting to improve, precicsely at the time we increased the Luvox dosage, thus stalling the progress.<br /><br />But it\'s not the increase in dosage that interfered with the progress, but rather, the increased dosage is ER (extended release) and should have been switched to morning, while the prior non-ER Luvox was taken at night to avoid daytime drowsiness.<br /><br />Such nuances in the context of the sheer amount of management we\'re doing day to day are easy to miss, even by the meds doctor, but fortunately, the GP is the one who suggested the switch from night to morning, and we could then figure out from our notes what must have happened.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, Mike is using a therapy lamp each morning upon waking. The idea is that the light therapy can nudge the sleep onset time to become slightly earlier, leading to slightly earlier waking, allowing the light therapy to then be done earlier, and so forth. It keeps reinforcing the better schedule. That can take weeks or even a few months.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Here is an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3501671/" target="_blank">NIH review</a>&nbsp;which, even back in 2015, suggests that gut microbial flora (gut microbiome) is an area that needs more research for sleep problems in patients with ME/CFS.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Moving Outside of Meds</span></h1><span style="font-family: arial;">As those familiar with this illness know, it is treated one symptom at a time because there is no cure.

They undervalue doing their own research, they take&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">little to no interest in their patient\'s input, they won\'t admit they don\'t know something, and some still denigrate use of the internet -- an outdated notion.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><span style="font-family: arial;">As an ME/CFS and Long Covid patient team, Mike and I advocate and research a great deal before visiting any doctor. We arrive armed.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">After a mix of trial and error, insistence, and some doctor switching, Mike and I now have a team of doctors who welcome our research; they run to their copiers or click the links we provide them.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">That\'s as it should be.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Where we\'ve landed with our doctor team was not without some effort, but if we can do it, you can do it. In the end, you might even have to do a doctor switch or two, just as we had to, but you might not need to. Read on.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Some advocacy advice</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I</span><span style="font-family: arial;">f you\'re showing up armed with your homework and suggestions, only to find it less than welcome, this is not time to back off. Your health is more important than your feelings of intimidation.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">If you have felt marginalized by a doctor, you must work on your courage, b</span><span style="font-family: arial;">e insistent, and stay that way for every visit.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">You have more power than you might realize. Remembering that doctors are only human, your doctor might need your nudges. You could end up being their model for what patients want in the 2020\'s. You can transform them into better doctors for everyone.</span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We have successfully fast-tracked Mike\'s trek by providing research and ideas.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s a smattering of examples of us taking the initiative:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We suggested certain changes in his neuropsychiatric meds, to which our doctor was open, and they ended up being the exact right thing for Mike.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We provided a Long Covid specialist eighteen pages that included Mike\'s Long Covid history, research, and our suggestions. As a result, she was able to ask us much deeper questions than she otherwise would have.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">After one of our doctors turned down several of our suggestions for OTC alternative remedies, we didn\'t get discouraged. Instead, we continued throwing one or two OTC remedies into our research, and as a result, he did approve one, which we are hopeful about.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Because of the number of doctors we had to communicate with, we eventually realized that his GP, who should have been the one at the helm, was falling behind. So we suggested that she and Mike schedule a standing monthly virtual visit, and she heartily agreed to this.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">One time, when the GP\'s care team tried to send us to the emergency room, we showed them evidence that patients with ME/CFS get these very symptoms often, and we showed them why the ER should be the last resort. As a result, they backed off quickly and found other medically sound alternatives to an ER visit</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We\'re the ones who suggested CBD or THC to one of our doctors, and when we showed the doctor what we bought, he evaulated our purchases, agreed, and offered suggestions for dosages. We know he would not have independently brought up canabanoids at that time.</span></li></ol><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But you and doc won\'t always agree</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, you won\'t always be right. Your doctor, after all, has a wealth of knowledge.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">After considering our research, we\'ve had doctors sometimes disagree with us and offer a better idea. Here\'s why that\'s just as good an outcome:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><b><span style="font-size: medium;">We secretly know that when a doctor carefully considers our research first, this leads to a more well-considered next step</span></b></span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And so, either way, whether the doctor goes with our lead or counters with something else, we are able to genuinely thank them for their help, and we walk out of the office (or virtual office) smiling.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">Join my  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group.

Imagine you start out your day with 12 spoons to spend. (Or maybe you\'ll devise a different number for yourself.)<br /><br />You can spend only those spoons, and then you have to stop. If you overdo it, you can end up with Post Exertional Symptom Excacerbation (PESE).<br /><br />You don\'t want PESE. Everything stops completely, and for us it was measurable in weeks, not days.<br /><br />All exertion requires spoons. Exertions are emotional, cognitive, social, physical.&nbsp;</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">As an example, many folks with ME/CFS spend two or more spoons just on taking a shower.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;

And it\'s been that way for the last six days. We are pretty sure it’s in response to the off-label higher dose of the Luvox, as it dropped right at the 14 day mark of the new dose.

Here\'s what I figured out:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Ask specifically for occasional check-ins</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If folks offer to visit with me, ask them to provide a date, time, and location.

Caregivers are drained too. And self-awareness is hard to reach when one is already drained.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I want to be more useful to others.

For some symptoms, he uses a rating system on a scale from 0 to 100.<br /><br />For many months, Mike\'s morning report on three of those symptoms has been:<br /><br />10: anxiety<br />30: depression<br />70 to 90: fatigue<br /><br />But as of December 4, his morning report has been this:<br /><br />10: anxiety<br />20: depression<br />70 to 90: fatigue</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />The slight drop in the depression score is not minor. That depression score has never been under a 30 since the start of his Long Covid, eleven months ago.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />Yes it\'s only been four days since it dropped to a 20. But even one day of a 20 is an encouragement. And it\'s been four!<br /><br />He\'s still sleeping 9 to 13 hours a night, and the fatigue is still high regardless of sleep quantity or quality, but the slight drop in depression is good news.<br /><br />We\'re pretty sure we know why it dropped. Two weeks before December 4, we upped his Luvox from the standard 100mg to the off-label 150mg. It was something to try. We think it\'s working.<br /><br />It was a suggestion I had made to Dr. Parikh (the meds doctor) and Dr. Parikh was open to it. </span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Those Long Covid patients who benefit most from any forward movement are those with loved ones advocating and caregiving.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, to this day, coming up on 2023, the medical community isn\'t in charge of coordinating patient care.

So here\'s yet another saga.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">This one happend this morning. The front desk person responsible for taking my information did these things:<ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">She told me they only do Telehealth and is that okay, and I said yes.</span></li><li>When I told her I\'m caring for a loved one with Post Covid Syndrome, also known as Long Covid, she said "I never heard of that. What are the symptoms of that?" (All I can think is "For real? A counseling service?") But I continued making the plans.</li><li>She told me I have to call my insurance company and then call her back with an auth code.</li><li>When I called her back with the auth code she claimed unkindly that she had already told me I\'d also need to give her an end date. I continued making plans, continuing to keep my cool.</li><li>Then when we were done setting up everything, she asked me for my phone number. Only then did she point out my sessions would be a phone call and she unkindly underscored that I had aleady agreed to phone call sessions.</li><li>When I pointed out, undertstandably at this point, that  what she had actually asked me was about telehealth, she denied ever using the word "telehealth."</li></ol>The miscommunications are typical of the many times I tried to get counseling from various places in the past. Many of them don\'t even involve a real person initially. But this real person was worse than a bot. This person had an attitude.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />How can such a vulnerable population as we all are, withstand trusting an uknown therapist whose face to the world behaves this way?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />So I cancelled.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />When I then called back my insurance company to let them know to cancel the auth code, and to tell them what happened (with the office they had recommended to me) the woman was sympathetic, and even outright agreed with me when I said:<br /><br /><b>"Seeking help with mental health symptoms exacerbates the symptoms."</b><br /><br />As I\'ve posted before, the mental health system is overloaded. My guess is that this office worker was a cheap hire and not well trained. That\'s not an excuse for our entire healthcare system mistreating the folks who need them the most.<br /><br />I\'ll keep my out-of-pocket, very expensive, meds doctor, thank you. <br /><br /> Join my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Long Covid Mind</a> Facebook group, which is still new and small <br /> <br />Join the very active <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/COVID19survivorcorps">Survivor Corps</a> Facebook group</span></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/12/a-new-app-is-helping-us-with-exertion.html', 'title': '22-12-01 A new app is helping us with exertion', 'content': '<div><span style="font-family: arial;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjogTbyhMbCiNhcVKw_uptuGFl8wzHD_5fNLAaWTUNFIn19e2WsfByrYxgrpVceJUHU11feaNgM4Y7ie-tj65F4iDEhUVl-DuT7qcrdMMPnObzBtgpkEmqyLYDLBTheC_2XvLNf5DYZSMfsjXkg39RlJzXsAS1KJf0FKr0dPyOoR2_fDed5iJGQV9sEew/s240/unnamed.webp" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="240" data-original-width="240" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjogTbyhMbCiNhcVKw_uptuGFl8wzHD_5fNLAaWTUNFIn19e2WsfByrYxgrpVceJUHU11feaNgM4Y7ie-tj65F4iDEhUVl-DuT7qcrdMMPnObzBtgpkEmqyLYDLBTheC_2XvLNf5DYZSMfsjXkg39RlJzXsAS1KJf0FKr0dPyOoR2_fDed5iJGQV9sEew/s1600/unnamed.webp" width="240" /></a></div>Pacing and protecting Mike from exertion has been the name of the game for a few months now.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We once thought we knew his limits, at least to some degree, but the illness has morphed since then, and he\'s now more affected by lesser exertions.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We understand now that, ideally, he needs to live a life of total leisure, with no obligations, nothing required of him ever.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time, we were advised at one of the Post Covid Clinics of an app that will help measure fatigue and then, each morning, advise him based on the previous four days of HRV.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">HRV is Heart Rate Variability. It correlates with fatigue so well that the app is helping us.

We\'ll take anybody willing to try. It\'s painful to have people fall away. It\'s painful to get too little support.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><p style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If I burn out, that\'s a problem. And truth be told, I\'m starting to feel it. So I\'m probably asking months after I should have.</span></p><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Let me shout this: it is so easy to think that someone who has taken on the role of caregiver doesn\'t need help. Caregivers need support, badly.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If I\'ve come across as "I\'ve got this," I don\'t have this.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b>So regardless if...</b></span></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>You know us well or hardly at all</li><li>You\'v been in touch or not</li><li>You haven\'t known how to help before or want to change how you help</li></ul></div></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b>... here\'s how to help&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The most important help I need right now, from anybody willing, is to reach out to me on a regular basis. That can be by text or email or regular reading and commenting on any of my web assets, or a mix of any of this.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is not an acute illness. It\'s chronic. That means it\'s long-term. That means we burn out our supports. We understand that. We may continue to need a rotation of concern over the coming months (or longer).&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And it\'s become too hard for us to be the ones reaching out. If you\'ve read about Spoon Theory, we are both limited in our spoons.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b>But if in my response, I ask "and how are you?"...</b></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;">...It doesn\'t mean we\'re fine. Caring about others when I\'m in crisis is part of who I am, and it helps me get outside of myself. So I do want to know, if you\'d like to share.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b>Alternatively...</b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If you are someone who has been able to keep up with the details in my web assets, and wants to "give it a go" at supplementing my research with an open mind and heart, go for it.

It\'s exhausting.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But be kind to me please. I\'ve actually had someone criticize my efforts at trying to get Mike well. I\'ll fall apart if you do that.

But in the past month, they seem to be recurring.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So I\'ve researched some more, and discovered they are common to the flare-ups, also called relapses, also called crashes, of Post Exertional Malaise:</span></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Nausea</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Vertigo&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Vomiting&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Stomach cramps&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b>And the Exertions can be</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">...I\'ve learned that the above symptoms can be triggered by any of these exertions, even if they are positive exertions:</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">physical</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">cognitive</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">mental</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">social</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">emotional&nbsp;</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b>And now PEM has been renamed</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In addition, his current ME/CFS symptom of fatigue and sleep onset delay have gotten worse in response to the above exertions.That is, they are part of the relapse.<br /></span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">By way of just one datapoint: on Thanksgiving Day, his wakeup time was 3 pm.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Thus, PEM has now been more accurately renamed to PESE, which stands for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Post Exertional Symptom Exacerbation.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: large;"><b>Where we are with this today</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In the last month, Mike\'s had three relapses, the most recent being yesterday. Those consist of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">new symptoms and a worsening of his ME/CFS symtpoms, all in response to exertions of any kind.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">May I be candid here and say this continues to be a nightmare? We now know that even</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;happy social or emotional exertions are a trigger for PESE. Some sufferers discover the hard way that they can have only have one-on-one interactions. We hope this isn\'t the case for Mike.</span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">But what I\'m seeing on Survivor Corps so far today isn\'t good news -- our extensive online community is suffering from Thanksgiving. They are reporting crashes and relapses -- even those who had a good holiday.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We have new decisions to make about the next holiday which is coming up soon.

They scheduled it for 4:30 that afternoon</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">At the appointment time, Mike learned that they had scheduled him for someone licensed in New York, not in New Jersey</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We then told them their mistake, and requested an appropriate doctor</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">They then sent him the same doctor again&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It would have been a nightmare for Mike if I hadn\'t been the one to do the contacting. He was in no shape</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Now it\'s Thanksgiving. We\'re still waiting to hear back about a virtual appointment&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">The other doctors office which:&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">never got back to us</span></li></ul></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">These are typical things that have happened. Our whole medical system is screwed up but it\'s even worse for patients with this kind of illness. See my other most recent post about that.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So now it\'s Thanksgiving, and he was still awake at 5:30 this morning.

I was given numerous hours to be heard.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I allowed myself to get a little excited. But now I realize the joke\'s on me, and I am able to laugh (sometimes).</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>There come to mind, off the top of my head, eight kinds of illnesses and disabilities that are especially hard for all humans to warm up to, stick with, and keep an open mind about:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><ol><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Chronic&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Invisible&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">New&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Politicized</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Contagious</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Underfunded</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Ever-mutating</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>Neuro-psychiatric</span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And the shocking fact:&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Long Covid (aka Post Covid Syndrome) is all eight. Thus it is misunderstood, maligned, marginalized, devalued, feared, denied, misrepresented, ignored, and mitigated, even by many who\'ve had Covid-19 with full recovery. And sadly, for others (but not for us) by their own closest loved ones.</span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And just to add to those eight, Long Covid is confounding to the medical community, as the illness has over two hundred possible symptoms. Thus they are little more informed than the rest of us, and horribly, often mis-informed.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So I offered to this indivdiual some specific examples of frustrating, upsetting utterances that have come to Mike and me which are alienating. They come from practically everywhere. My purpose was to illustrate the horror of this illness, not some indictment of humanity.</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;It\'s just too hard to understand.</span></div><div><big><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br /></span></big></div><span style="font-family: arial;">I thought I was making progress with this person, but alas, the result was that this individual did not catch on. Worse, they told me that if I really feel like "nobody understands" then it means there must be something wrong with me.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Even worse than that, they tried to explain to me that I have human flaws too. Well duh. That\'s not the topic. But perhaps worst of all, they told me I\'m full of b.s., "just like everybody else." Sorry, but that\'s not one of my traits. I\'m earnest. Too earnest. </span><div><big><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br /></span></big></div><span style="font-family: arial;">I give up. It\'s okay. Now I can laugh and move on. My startling discovery only underscores the precise point I\'ve been trying to make to anyone who will listen. It\'s time to stop banging my head against a wall, and stick with the ones who\'ve caught on.<br /><br />So here\'s where I\'ve landed: I am grateful to have a small, wonderful support group of people. And why is it, then, that these few were able to catch on? A combination of reasons:<br /><br /><b>Only those most close to Mike and me -- who love us, trust us, believe in us, and were willing and able to make the sacrifice of time and attention</b></span><b><span style="font-family: arial;">.</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;Plus, they happen to be curious, open-minded, people-savvy, and insightful, and they don\'t run with the pack.&nbsp;</span></b></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />It appeals to the reasoning mind, then, that it takes all of those things to be spared from too much pain. Our inner circle will make mistakes, too. We make mistakes ourselves when speaking of this illness. But they\'re coming from a different place than all others.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Oh and let\'s not forget we get understood every single day on Survivor Corps, which is backed by a medical team and has 191,900 members. And so we actually have thousands who understand us. I\'m at peace now.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />If you join Survivor Corps, you\'ll quickly see that, although the symptoms vary from one person to the next, the universal refrain is "nobody understands me."<br /><br />And so, returning to what was said to me (that it must be my own problem) then it is also the problem of every person with this illness and their caregivers. </span><div><big><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br /></span></big></div><span style="font-family: arial;">Given that 1 in 13 adults in the U.S. have Long Covid symptoms, that\'s 25 million people who suffer from "nobody understands me." And that number doesn\'t include their caregivers, such as yours truly. Here\'s the source of the above numbers: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm">CDC</a>.<br /><br />Lest this post be misunderstood, let me now shout -- it\'s human nature to misconstrue something so complex. So this post isn\'t about anybody\'s failings. We all have failings. We all say the wrong thing sometimes or misunderstand. And it\'s not about lack of caring. Rather, it\'s about why this illness is exceptionally lonely in a crowd.<br /><br />I\'m holding out for the possibility that my writing will still spread understanding, as I know I\'m a better writer than speaker.

It lasted a few weeks, and was even worse than the ME/CFS itself. He says it felt like an elephant on his chest,&nbsp;</big><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">pushing him back down when he tries to get up.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">If you can\'t imagine an elephant on your chest, then imagine that lead apron you get for x-rays at the dentist. He\'s been wearing three of those at once, non-stop for weeks.</span></span></div><div><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></big></div><div><big><span style="font-family: arial;">The PEM happened because Mike is new at having ME/CFS, and is still learning about what it means to self-pace.</span></big></div><div><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></big></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">Most folks with ME/CFS have it for life. With the help of their doctor and meds, they learn how to manage it with a strong focus on relentless self-pacing.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">That\'s where we are now. Even if he recovers entirely from ME/CFS, it will be a long time before we even are sure of that. Here\'s why: people with ME/CFS have a recurring cycle of remissions and relapses for life. So if he starts feeling better, it doesn\'t mean he\'s recovering. It could be a remission.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">The medical community doesn\'t know yet whether ME/CFS, caused by Covid-19, is any different from ME/CFS caused by other viruses. We can only go with what is currently known.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">So now that the PEM seems to be resolving, he\'s back to where he was a month ago. That is, he has ME/CFS-- he has extreme fatigue, moderate depression, and sleep problems.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">For two whole days, we were relieved to be back where we were a month ago.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">But last night he had three new things happen:</span></div><div><ol><li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">Nausea</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">Headaches</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">Severe nightmares</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">I looked up those three symptoms, and discovered that they are part of ME/CFS. We\'re still learning.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">I also learned from research that ME/CFS patients get new symptoms over time. Well,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">maybe in Mike\'s case it\'s an anomaly. That would be nice. But we don\'t know yet.</span></div></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">Thus we are looking even more deeply into how to manage ME/CFS. After visiting two Long Covid specialists, we still have not been referred to an ME/CFS specialist. The reason for that is not much has ever been known by ME/CFS specialists. As a reminder, until now, ME/CFS has been underfunded and understudied. Until now, all they\'ve done is help patients manage symptoms.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">Here\'s a great resource for people with ME/CFS, and those who love them:</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/13-minimizing-relapses" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;" target="_blank">Minimizing Relapses</a><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 19.2px;"><br /></span></div><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><i><div><big><br /></big></div>Support my Long Covid Mind Facebook group by joining<br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidmind">Click here to see it</a></i></span></big><span style="font-family: arial;"><big><br /></big></span></div><big><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></big>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/11/11-10-path-to-recovery.html', 'title': '22-11-10 The Path to Recovery', 'content': '<p><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOSaJ9PGH53ug1bX6fhfWl6cySS6mHNCIYrZesIGd5fHikjckB8lJiCoQjJYPThIrSTCuX1MjOBAH8Ld2eTF2Dh6w1yWV-FvGk2_vPvqLZuKk4p4Cv45Sy4oiSybAUqH47QrRjdXb1T_7co5DCNZAq7yqmSSpFTb7M1js7HukEBWDQrcMvknJsiSyOfg/s612/istockphoto-1227613191-612x612.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="285" data-original-width="612" height="186" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOSaJ9PGH53ug1bX6fhfWl6cySS6mHNCIYrZesIGd5fHikjckB8lJiCoQjJYPThIrSTCuX1MjOBAH8Ld2eTF2Dh6w1yWV-FvGk2_vPvqLZuKk4p4Cv45Sy4oiSybAUqH47QrRjdXb1T_7co5DCNZAq7yqmSSpFTb7M1js7HukEBWDQrcMvknJsiSyOfg/w400-h186/istockphoto-1227613191-612x612.jpg" width="400" /></a><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Long Covid sufferers have been set back for many reasons outside their control, including outdated medical advice about fatigue, too few Post Covid Clinics, and many folks don\'t even know what\'s wrong.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: arial;">Not to mention that some folks think Long Covid is a religion, and they don\'t believe.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">But let\'s not go there.</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why Mike\'s path to recovery was delayed</span></h2><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We had some disadvantages:</span></div><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">An ignorant psychiatrist prescribed the wrong meds</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Same ignorant psychiatrist trashed Mike\'s hope, leading to serious setbacks</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We were trying to stay in network with doctors</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Outdated advice from the medical community about pushing through fatigue</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Lack of medical terminology</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Lack of a diagnosis code</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Egregious side effects from incorrect meds</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Lack of understanding on the part of doctors; they\'re waiting for the research to be done</span></li></ol><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But we did have some advantages, too</span></h2><div style="text-align: left;"><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">I found an online support group consisting of hundreds of sufferers who do their homework, and, like us, are in some ways ahead of their doctors.

PEM is a serious setback in ME/CFS recovery.</span></p></div><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></h2><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s the PEM symptom as described by the CDC:</span></h2><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 17px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">People with ME/CFS often describe this experience as a “crash,” “relapse,” or “collapse.” During PEM, any ME/CFS symptoms may get worse or first appear, including difficulty thinking, problems sleeping, sore throat, headaches, feeling dizzy, or severe tiredness.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 17px;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 17px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It may take days, weeks, or longer to recover from a crash.

We made this appointment a half year ago.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />And yesterday was the day. We saw Dr. Fernando Carnavali, who is the coordinator for Mount Sinai Center for Post-COVID Care. He apologized for that half-year wait. They\'re inundated.<br /><br />Similar to last week\'s visit (to the PCC at Columbia) they asked a lot of questions, and they were happy to scan the 14 pages I handed them of graphs and history.<br /><br />Also similar to last week\'s visit with Dr. Galal, this doctor thought that Mike is already in excellent hands with Dr. Parikh, and that we\'ve handled most of the symptoms.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">He did say that they are seeing many Long Covid patients with profound fatigue, which is what Mike has. And they still haven\'t figured it out.<br /><br />By the time he finished crossing off and ruling out treatments and tests, he had only one suggestion left on his list: physical therapy. This was not a surprise, as I\'ve met multiple patients on social media who also have been advised to seek physical therapy.<br /><br />Mount Sinai seems to be more oriented toward studies of nuero-PASC than Columbia was, and they appear to be following a cohort, which Mike is now part of. They have trained a few dozen physical therapists in specific knowledge and techniques for Long Covid patients.<br /><br />So he gave us a list of those PT\'s to choose from. He added that they can help with Mike\'s dizziness, and rebuilding his functioning level. It\'s called "reconditioning." This is not grueling PT by any means. Its purpose is to gently help the brain and body along to slowly heal from the fatigue with no pushing. And it\'s all in a controlled setting.<br /><br />I asked the doctor if Mike could faint during his dizzy spells, as I\'ve read about patients with his condition, fainting with no warning. The doctor said that indeed, Mike could faint.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">We\'re watching that closely.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And Dr. Carnavali concurs with Dr. Parikh and Dr. Galal that Mike must eliminate as many stressful events as possible and that he must pace himself every single day, no skipping. He should only do what\'s necessary.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Dr. Carnavali is certain that the fatigue is up to 90 because Mike tried to do too much in the last month. That happened because he had business commitments he had made a year ago, before he got sick.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Although he\'s stll working, he\'s working at only a quarter of his former pace. He\'s avoiding all commitments to the degree that he can. If he hs to travel while still recovering, he will take more days on the road to spread it all out.

When I\'m in some kind of trauma or crisis, whether it\'s acute or long-term, there\'s something I do: I continue to reach out and care about the concerns of those I\'m closest to.&nbsp;</span></div><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And they do the same for me. My closest loved ones manage to still be in my support circle, even when they\'re having their own trauma. A few ways it\'s good for me, and I imagine it\'s good for them too:</span></p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s healthy for me to get out of my own pain&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s good for my perspective -- others have crises and problems too</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It helps me to remain close to them when I stay in their lives</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It helps me to remind them of my care and concern for them, even when I\'m in pain too</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It sets a tone for myself of "bad is bad." It\'s not a competition.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">It makes me happy that I can do this. And that I have a close circle of loved ones who do this for me. I\'m so lucky. And of course, these exchanges don\'t have to be 50-50. Sometimes they\'re 70-30. Other times they might be 30-70.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Even Mike has been a support to me through taking care of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Some of how my support folks have helped me:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">You have listened and taken interest, even though you have your own stuff</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">You don\'t rate and rank your traumas against mine. You accept that "bad is bad"</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">You don\'t vie for who has the worst problem, except sometimes in a generous direction lol!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">My mentally and physically handicapped son is my role model of giving while getting. He receives services, but also provides services to the handicapped.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">As persons in trauma, it\'s good to do these things. We need to try and do some kind of exchange.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">I don\'t claim to do this well all the time, but it\'s something I value.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s not good to forget others\' pain, or they will indeed burn out as support providers. We need to be open to them even while we\'re in our own trauma. T</span><span style="font-family: arial;">here are small and loving ways to do that.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And on the flip side, we need to marginalize those who cannot do the same for us.

This is what I hear from folks who have ME/CFS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">But by his own self-report, Mike\'s still having only bad days. There\'s little to no fluctuation from one day to the next. Rather, he is doing minimal, necessary, functioning each day, and that\'s all.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Will we know what to do when a good day comes? How will we recognize it? How does pacing work when one is having a good day?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I met someone this week who has had ME/CFS for many years, and has those ups and downs.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">For her, boredom is a good indicator. On her bad days, she never feels bored. But if she\'s lying on the couch one day and her brain registers boredom, she might be heading toward a few good days.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">When that happens, she makes careful attempts to do a bit more, such as make her own lunch. Sometimes her body is still not able, but other times, it is. She paces accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike says he\'s not been bored once yet. But that description is a help to us. Management of this illness involves self-awareness under a microscope.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">His first recognition of boredom will be a tiny step up. But even looking forward to boredom is a tiny step up. It adds to our hope.</span></p>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/10/10-27-know-even-one-fact-about-lc-and.html', 'title': '22-10-27 Know one fact; become mighty', 'content': '<p><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfyDMbNIWnUFVqhWKRltCWw5ABGqCTyg8pcbdpD4lLoTcP_L2J2dPvQiHsNl-y3ksbgiSyM8DQfxh7WiZMO7j8QYtHlX7puRB6AMivx1Vv9tsNA7ELMs0NiaWi8RAsBWEGuz8eIPT8do8IS8W4AzmTzDLPevQyeePNdNzrc7vGR-RA5pRN-ffBy77J0g/s450/new.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="338" data-original-width="450" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfyDMbNIWnUFVqhWKRltCWw5ABGqCTyg8pcbdpD4lLoTcP_L2J2dPvQiHsNl-y3ksbgiSyM8DQfxh7WiZMO7j8QYtHlX7puRB6AMivx1Vv9tsNA7ELMs0NiaWi8RAsBWEGuz8eIPT8do8IS8W4AzmTzDLPevQyeePNdNzrc7vGR-RA5pRN-ffBy77J0g/s320/new.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>I\'m thinking maybe we\'d all go crazy if we had to understand every medical condition and disability in existence. Even the medical community is unable to study them all.</span></div><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Instead, what we tend to do mainly is to learn about an illness or disability when it affects us or a loved one directly. I totally agree with that strategy.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I\'m the first to admit I\'d like to stay ignorant about most conditions. And in fact, I\'m not even learning about all of Long Covid. I\'m zooming in mostly on Mike\'s particular symptoms.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">So why bother to know anything at all about Long Covid? Why is it so powerful to just have a few facts or an anecdote at the ready? And why is it so important?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I\'ll summarize first by saying Long Covid is the perfect storm of all the worst circumstances:</span></p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Each patient gets a selection of symptoms from a range of over two hundred assorted, seemingly unrelated symptoms. (The NY Times reports the number as 203.)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">The CDC only announced the new diagnosis in July of 2022. It\'s called "PASC" but that hasn\'t done much good yet because of item #1 above. It\'s not specific enough yet.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Most of the medical community is still in an information vacuum and so are all of us.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Information holes are always filled by misinformation and assumptions. It\'s human nature, and sadly, that fact is true of care providers, too.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Cultural norms and constraints can serve as a deterrent to science and good information.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Denial is an even more universal deterrent -- it protects our sense of safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Many ongoing studies of Long Covid have not yet published their results. It takes time.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It is still unknown who might get Long Covid, so we have to assume that means everyone.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">The mildness or even lack of Covid symptoms doesn\'t rule out risk of Long Covid.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Thus even sharing one fact can help spread good information. Or one anecdote about someone you know with Long Covid. You don\'t have to know much to know far more than most. Some folks will hear it, especially if they already know and respect you.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">In the world of illness and disability, advocacy has long been expected from those who have the specific conditions. It\'s called self-advocacy, and it\'s been extolled for sound reasons, but it\'s not easy. They and their loved ones are already bogged down and limited by the condition. They need help from friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">So there\'s a tiny role any of us can play, to help fill in the vacuum, even if it\'s just spreading around a good article or two. Or sharing one fact or anecdote. And sharing proper terminology such as "Post Covid Syndrome" or "PASC" (which stands for this mouthful: P</span><span style="font-family: arial;">ost Acute Sequelae of Covid-19</span><span style="font-family: arial;">). The term "Long Covid" is still used, but "Post Covid Syndrome" is better.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">In case you\'re not persuaded, here\'s my closing thought: because of Long Covid,</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;families are being torn apart right this very minute. Spouses are leaving, relatives are going no-contact, and doctors are misdiagnosing and even dropping patients. Sufferers of this illness are still being misunderstood, maligned, devalued, and accused of laziness. I know these things because I\'m involved with Survivor Corps. I read their stories every day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Don\'t even get me started with the inequities that have resulted. I know it\'s behind a paywall, but here\'s the New York Times predicting it:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/health/long-covid-black.html" target="_blank">Experts warn of racial disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of long Covid</a>.</span>&nbsp;</p>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/10/10-22-yup-pem-has-happened.html', 'title': "22-10-23 It's known as PEM", 'content': '<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZMjfKYizCyyThV4ld2PyeLdPNNIvZtKoGklXvlV0h_mYI18n2xCksbGV7HxjOW_IlpxtEokv9DRAyuSoTeA4dRlN5FOHFTw9BOgovChdW7Tq9l96bHLkcLkhscDARgkeHMnK3gRjWyLJtIK3-H0vNYgvvpdI3b5zd-ScKzGMUQhm2iFSnKCXMW9kjAQ/s600/pasc.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="438" data-original-width="600" height="234" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZMjfKYizCyyThV4ld2PyeLdPNNIvZtKoGklXvlV0h_mYI18n2xCksbGV7HxjOW_IlpxtEokv9DRAyuSoTeA4dRlN5FOHFTw9BOgovChdW7Tq9l96bHLkcLkhscDARgkeHMnK3gRjWyLJtIK3-H0vNYgvvpdI3b5zd-ScKzGMUQhm2iFSnKCXMW9kjAQ/s320/pasc.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Long Covid causes ME/CFS (formerly known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) the study of which has been underfunded for decades but is now getting renewed attention due to the explosion of Long Covid.</div></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">ME/CFS has to be managed with "pacing."

If it works, it works. But as a culture, we tend to relegate placebo effect to weak-mindedness or lack of scientific proof.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In doing so, we devalue its place in the world of medicine.</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Since the placebo effect was first demonstrated in the 18th century, it has been simultaneously marginalized and acknowledged for its effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">When we bought that weighted blanket, I became interested in the placebo effect. Something about the blanket appealed to Mike so much that he looked forward to going to bed. For someone with a sleep disorder, this is significant.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">A weighted blanket is reported to work well for night waking, but we were trying to use it for sleep onset. So I wondered if it might work anyway. That got me thinking...perhaps placebo effect is especially effective when it comes to sleep. After all, when we lie awake, we get increasingly stressed about not being alseep. If we believe something will work, we relax.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So I pounded google, and discovered something interesting -- placebo effect gets more serious and detailed attention as it applies to sleep disorders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So here\'s two articles I found about sleep that take a more scientific and proper view of placebo effect:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31504091/#:~:text=Results%3A%20Overall%2C%20placebo%20treatment%20significantly,effect%20on%20any%20sleep%20outcome" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: arial;">Choice, Expectations, and the Placebo Effect for Sleep Difficulty</span></a></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-weighted-blankets-help-with-insomnia-202111152637" style="font-family: arial;" target="_blank">Do weighted blankets help with insomnia</a><span style="font-family: arial;">?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In the world of sleep disorders, the importance of placebo effect appeals to the reasoning mind.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And here\'s one nugget I picked up from my reading: so far, the studies show that if you know it\'s a placebo, it still works.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />Picture above w<span style="text-align: center;">ith thanks to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://elemental.medium.com/can-weighted-blankets-heal-your-psyche-36122df3ab29#:~:text=To%20some%20extent%2C%20that\'s%20all,when%20it%20comes%20to%20sleep" style="text-align: center;" target="_blank">Elemental</a><br />\nComments?

It\'s likely his hunger will return to normal in time. Wellbutrin can lead to increased anxiety, trouble sleeping and lack of hunger, but can fade once your body acclimates.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Wellbutrin is a unique drug because it is an NDRI which works differently than SSRIs/SRNIs which work on Serotonin&nbsp;(this is how much of psychiatric treatment of depression has been based on for many decades, and&nbsp;actually there\'s new evidence that none of it has been much better than placebo pills). NDRI is a new-er class of drugs that works on&nbsp;Norepinephrine and Dopamine&nbsp;instead.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Other drugs in the same class are used for ADHD treatment because they can be helpful for focus and energy, so this route makes sense as it could also help with focus and brain fog. Research is still emerging about it but they seem to have less side effects than SSRIs.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Things to look out for is because it\'s a depression treatment that boosts energy, sometimes people can see increases in suicidal ideation, which is the big thing to report if that shows up.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s also possible he might see the anxiety spike back up, at least temporarily. This med route makes sense to me though. And withdrawal is really minimal compared to many other depression treatment drugs so it\'s very safe to come off of if it doesn\'t pan out.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">You may have already tried these things for sleep too but—Melatonin and Magnesium (especially magnesium glycinate, used in combination with melatonin) can help regulate sleep cycles. 5-HTP also helps with the production of melatonin. If he\'s tried melatonin and found it useless, a higher dose might help but it could also be an issue of magnesium deficiency which is common in older adults.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Figured I\'d suggest some supplements since you won\'t want to be experimenting with other meds while he\'s adjusting to a med. If he\'s still on gabapentin, I would take that one at nighttime since it&nbsp;can make you sleepy. I would also highly recommend taking CBD as part of a high-CBD low-THC combo -- CBD is just not very effective on its own as much as the CBD industry really wants people to believe it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-size: small;" /></span></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />\nComments?

I\'m still learning too.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And here\'s a few of my own suggestions, tailored to Mike:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Suspend all knowledge you might already have; this illness is too individual and too new.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Cultivate curiosity and stay open-minded; be willing to self-correct assumptions.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Avoid both extreme positivity and extreme negativity. Even avoid too many words of encouragment.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Refrain from drawing conclusions.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Recognize that this is not a big emotional thing. It\'s a daily thing.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">This illness as so many different moving parts; if you hear of a "step forward," be open to hear about its often accompanying "step back."</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Finding commonalities between you and the patient is nice, but use it judiciously. Better to mostly discern uniquness.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Take pride in the your good listening skills</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">This is a shoutout to all of our support group. Thank you for understanding that this condition is a daily thing, even if you can\'t keep up with the details. We are filled with gratitude for being cheered on, listened to, prayed for, and thought of.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Comments?

The population of patients with ME/CFS has grown considerably in the past few years as a result of Covid-19, resulting in a resurgence of interest.&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And better studies can be done now, again because of Long Covid. Past studies of ME/CFS relied on small populations of patients, all sick at different times, and who had been infected by a wide range of different viruses. In complete contrast, we now have a larger population, all sick at the same time, and they all had some form of Covid-19. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span><span><span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Further and newer studies may show slightly different results, but perhaps drastically different results are unlikely. </span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">A final thought about that second chart: Obviously, if a patient has more than one of these diseases or disabilities, they might swap their severity rankings. But that\'s only a population study of one.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>Comments? Questions? Advice?

Background: he has had hand tremors for decades, which got so bad in the last year that he had non-invasive, ultrasound brain surgery to correct the right hand which was worse than the left. We were content with that because his right hand is tremor-free since the surgery. But now the left hand tremors have worsened.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tremors are common to post COVID-19 conditions, and some experts suspect it\'s related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. This explanation fits Mike because all of his symptoms so far have been neurological.<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (a Circadian Rhythm Disorder).&nbsp; Sleep onset has moved to 3:30 am or later, and now it\'s followed by early waking instead of sleeping late. We\'ve tried the usual remedies; nothing has budged his sleep onset time so far, but we\'re still trying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />It is a known fact that sleep onset delays are common to ME/CFS, which Mike has as one of his post Covid illnesses.<br /><br />I recently reported some remedies he\'s embarking on (alongside his current prescriptions) but we just started:<br /><br /></span></li><ol><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Weighted blanket -- reportedly takes at least a week to get used to it and then another three weeks for it to start working, but Mike loved it instantly, so that\'s encouraging</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Magnesium and Melatonin which work together</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">CBD (in a 20 to 1 ratio with THC)<br /><br /></span></li></ol><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Sleep Deprived most days: Due to shortened sleep, he is now tired a lot, along with but separate from the fatigue. He is able to distinguish between the fatigue and the tiredness.<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Appetite: It&nbsp; has declined to zero. He now has to remember to eat at least one meal a day.<br /><br /></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Dizziness in the morning: We think it\'s from the Melatonin, as that happens to some folks who take Melatonin</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div></div><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Update on 10-10-22:</span></h2><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Last night Mike fell asleep at a normal time, and without alcohol. This is a stunning event. So the most likely causes of a better sleep onset could be the melatonin and the magnesium or it could be the weighted blanket or maybe it could be the probiotics (only because the probiotics are also new) or maybe the fatigue being higher yesterday and the day before. (Yes, his fatigue sometimes spikes from a 70 to an 80.)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Comments?

He said his brain fog has lifted since yesterday. He specifically mentioned that his focus and concentration are restored. In addition, his motivation is improved. He believes these changes to be due to the Wellbutrin, even though it\'s only been four days since he started it.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Interestingly, he still needs to rest a lot between activities, and he still rates the fatigue at a 70. His explanation is that he likens the effect of Wellbutrin to the effect of Sudafed when you have a cold -- it gives you some motivation to get things done even though you don\'t feel well.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><h4><span style="font-family: arial;">Some downsides and one neutral change in the last few days:</span></h4><div><ol><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s been consistently falling alseep very late, which could be exacerbated by the Wellbutrin and the lack of alcohol.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He is waking up too early and therefore is not well rested in the last two days.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">His appetite had been gradually disappearing in the last month. But in the last few days he has no appetite at all, and so he now has to eat on a schedule. He hasn\'t lost his sense of taste, though, and he does enjoy his meals. He just doesn\'t get hungry.&nbsp; The doctor hasn\'t been concerned.</span></li></ol><div><h1><span style="background-color: #f4cccc; font-family: arial;">The Original Post</span></h1></div></div><div><span style="background-color: #f4cccc; font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Experimenting is the name of this Long Covid game. Because the anxiety is close to gone, and the depression is improved (all due to ongoing medication) we are now turning our attention toward the very high Fatigue and his Sleep Onset delays.</span></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">While the two may sound connected, they might not be.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fatigue</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Fatigue is not about sleepiness. It is not resolved by getting enough sleep. Mike\'s specific form of fatigue is about lack of motivation, both physical and mental.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s possible that when the last of the depression resolves, that could help, but given that the depression is low (he reports as a 30) and the fatigue is high (he reports as a 70) it makes sense to not wait around for the depression to resolve. Heck, maybe the fatigue is even the cause of the depression rather than the result. Nobody has answers for this.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">There are many conventional and unconventional remedies and management strategies for fatigue, of which we are aware.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So far, Mike has been using the technique of "pacing" for the fatigue. And now here\'s what we\'re adding:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">CBD</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Wellbutrin</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div></div><div><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sleep Onset (aka Sleep Initiation)</span></h1><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Once Mike\'s asleep, he stays asleep, and almost always gets a refreshing sleep. So it\'s important to understand that there\'s more than one type of insomnia. What Mike has is called "Sleep Onset" delays. This means that in spite of efforts to rejigger his sleep schedule, his brain wants to fall asleep around 3:30 am, and wake up around 11:30. This schedule is not sustainable over the long term, as it is not conducive to running a business or being in step with friends, family, and leisure.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><span style="font-family: arial;">From the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3501671/?fbclid=IwAR1xIfHpZeh93NfLoNksL6B8t6MTJBBym-lRk3KAhVv6N-I1-kZ3kyFpAcQ#B39">NIH</a>, "Sleep onset latencies are often longer in CFS/ME patients compared to healthy control subjects, suggesting that some patients may have difficulties initiating sleep. It has been reported that CFS/ME patients may have differential parasympathetic activity at sleep onset, which may contribute to delayed sleep latency."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s tried many of the conventional strategies, although not all. And so far, the only remedy that works well is alcohol. Remarkably, the conventional wisdom that alcohol will cause sleep disruption has not been true for Mike. The alcohol works well for sleep onset, and then he sleeps well and wakes up refreshed. Because we were trying to address other, more impotant issues, the alcohol (2-3 drinks per night) has come in handy, and with the endorsement of the doctor.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">But now that the anxiety and depression are largely addressed, we feel we can more directly address the sleep onset. And anyway, we have to, because he\'s now on Wellbturin for the fatigue, which disallows alcohol.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as with fatigue, there are many suggested remedies of which we are aware.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s what we\'re trying:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">CBD</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">A weighted blanket</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Melatonin</span></li></ol><span style="font-family: arial;">We\'re not yet addressing the brain fog directly.

Read about that on <a href="https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/qa/what-is-the-difference-between-tiredness-and-fatigue#:~:text=Medically%20speaking%2C%20tiredness%20happens%20to,tiredness%20not%20relieved%20by%20sleep." target="_blank">WebMD</a>.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Patients with ME/CFS used to be told to use "trial and error" to achieve optimal balance between activity and rest. The theory was that too much activity can lead to PEM, while too little activity causes deconditioning (regression).</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">The deconditioning theory and its treatment with graded exercise has been disproven. Instead, the patient with ME/CFS should get as much rest as possible. See this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8544443/" target="_blank">NIH</a>&nbsp;publication.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, what Mike needs is energy conservation strategies, such as pacing, which we\'ve been referring to as "spoon theory" and he needs to minimize the stimuli to which he is sensitive. For him, that sensitiviy is limited to certain light and sound.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Symptoms can vary from one patient to the next. Not all patients get all the symptoms. Mike does not have the other sensitivies, nor does he have the pain, night waking, or the lesser common symptoms. He does have these ME/CFS symptoms</span></li><ol><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">impaired higher order thinking</span></li><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">sleep onset insomnia (aka initiation insomnia)</span></li><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">dizziness when getting up out of his chair too fast</span></li><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">impaired memory and concentration</span></li><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">difficulties with sleep onset</span></li><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">taking a long time to recover after physical activity</span></li><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">extreme lack of motivation and initiative</span></li><li class="TrT0Xe" style="list-style-type: disc; margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">exhaustion after daily tasks, such as taking a shower</span></li></ol><li><span style="font-family: arial;">There is no cure; it has to be managed. Some patients do eventually recover; others have to manage it for the rest of their lives. Too little is known about neuro-PASC to able to predict probabilities for Mike.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">ME/CFS is still not well understood and is still vastly misunderstood.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">What is established is that viruses are known for leading to autoimmune diseases such as Epstein-Barr, ME/CFS, Herpes, Lupus and others. Here\'s a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723519/table/viruses-11-00762-t001/?report=objectonly" target="_blank">list from the NIH</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol></div><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Good News, if that\'s possible</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The one up side of Long Covid\'s emergence as a contributor to autoimmune disease research is that it\'s pushing the medical community to re-evaluate ME/CFS (once known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) among many others.

So far, the sketchy evidence is that it probably won\'t last more than two years.&nbsp;</span><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Cognitive functioning has many components. It is granular. There is no way I would expect anyone to discern what\'s working and what\'s not working, just by spending a little time with Mike.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Indeed, there are only two people in total who we know can see some of these distinctions now, and they did need some&nbsp; details from me so they would know what to look for.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And in fact, I might have missed some of these details myself, had it not been for raising a child with cognitive impairments.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I don\'t mean to draw similarities between Mike and Dave. What I do mean, though, is that cognitive function is more than one thing. It\'s dozens and dozens, which we had to see up close and learn about in order to best augment David\'s education.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The following lists are for anyone who wants to really know what\'s happening with Mike.

He\'s had multiple MRI\'s for it over the years, and the final one was a year ago, but because of the effects of Covid on the brain, we did request one more MRI, which he had recently.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">The neurologist sees no change in the extra MRI. There have been no changes in all these years, and we are reminded that many people are likely walking around with a brain mass without knowing it, and it has no effect. The only reason we even found out about it was an unrelated issue that warranted an MRI. They can sometimes change over time, which is why we had all those MRI\'s in the past.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He says there is no chance that the location of the tumor could cause anxiety, depression, or fatigue. He said that if the tumor was growing (it isn\'t) that it would cause numbness and weakness on the left side of my body. We are on the lookout for such symptoms.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">As he already said a year ago, no more MRI\'s are needed unless Mike gets the aforemention symtpoms.</span></li></ol><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Psychiatrist:</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Today I did not accompany Mike but I did send him along with my latest list of questions, plus some reading for Dr.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Vijal&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Parikh. Results from today\'s visit:</span></div><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7642e0b8-7fff-85eb-f154-73c59e49f85a"><p dir="ltr" style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #222222; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He read the article </span><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20220921/Why-fatigue-from-long-COVID-goes-beyond-simply-feeling-tired.aspx" style="text-decoration-line: none;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">https://www.news-medical.net/news/20220921/Why-fatigue-from-long-COVID-goes-beyond-simply-feeling-tired.aspx</span></a></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Some of what was recommended in the article was experimental and not approved yet by the FDA, but he looked up a reference about use of an antibiotic to reduce brain inflammation and he wants to give that a try.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">If that doesn\'t work, he wants to try Wellbutrin.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He was not expecting the fatigue to get worse but says that\'s likely a direct result of Long COVID, rather than a symptom secondary to the anxiety or depression. He thinks that Mike shouldn\'t get any more tests or treatments except for maybe the antibiotics and Wellbutrin, because Mike will be seeing two Long COVID specialists* soon and because it might go away by itself by January.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He wants Mike to take the cannabis chocolate bars we obtained (CBD 20: THC 1) at night to see if that helps with the remaining depression and with sleep.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He agrees that Mike should sometimes fight the fatigue and sometimes rest depending on his judgement at the time. As my research has shown, fighting the fatigue can help heal the brain, but too much fighting can cause PEM (Post-exertional malaise&nbsp;) which can lead to a setback. So it\'s a balancing act.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He says that the inability to concentrate on watching TV and other things are about executive brain function and that the Wellbutrin might help with that or he might prescribe something that helps with ADD, because Mike\'s senses are being overwhelmed. But he wants to try other things first.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He says that Mike\'s ferritin levels (high or low) can be associated with fatigue but the therapeutic phlebotomies, which Mike\'s been getting for a few years, are helping with that.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He is not concerned with any other explanations for fatigue until we run the course with the Long COVID. That includes all the chronic fatigue, anemia, etc.--he doesn\'t want to look into any of it yet.

Each patient is unique. However, Mike can rank his own symptoms. That said, his observations:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Depression is better than anxiety&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Fatigue is better than depression&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What led to his conclusions:</span></h3><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Back in the middle of August, when the anxiety went down and the depression went up, Mike noted that the depression was preferable to the anxiety.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And now in these past two weeks, the depression has dropped. Yay! But the fatigue has risen alarmingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And now Mike notes that fatigue is preferable to depression.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And so, while it\'s still one step forward, one step back, it\'s progress nonetheless! (Sigh)</span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Some data points about his Severe Fatigue now:</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: arial;">He ranks his fatigue on a scale of 0 to 100.</span></div><p></p><ol><li><span style="font-family: arial;">From January 2022 to early September, the fatigue was 40 in the mornings and at night, but less noticeable mid-day</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">But the fatigue is now a steady 80 all the time, all day long</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He sometimes has gusts up to 100, which last about 15 seconds. It often happens when he is seated, thankfully</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He can\'t think clearly and has no motivation. He has to force himself to do everything</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He can watch game shows, but can\'t watch any other television</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He keeps his blinds closed and can only read&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He can\'t move his body without a lot of forcing himself</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Dr.&nbsp;Vijal&nbsp;Parikh agrees that the fatigue is a direct result of Long Covid, and not secondary to the depression or anxiety</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Fatigue is common to Long Covid, and often occurs near the end of the illness, and so we are slightly encouraged</span></li></ol><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And a few more things to note:</span></h3><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">A few days ago he had an anxiety spike and it was actually life-related! That is, anxiety that anyone might feel about a life event. It was short-lived. We celebrate that kind of anxiety.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">After 20 mg of THC, the depression drops from 30 to zero. But of course, it doesn\'t last, and while it does, he\'s a zombie.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s getting ready to try the suggested 1:20 CBD to THC in the form of an edible we\'ve obtained, but he may wait until his next Dr. Parikh appt.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Alcohol is now helping again -- this time it\'s helping him fall asleep and get a refreshing sleep. Dr. Parikh agrees with this for now because he understands that Mike needs the relief.

It\'s now harder to find than ever in this country, in part due to the burgeoning demands caused by the pandemic. I\'ve spent way too many spoons and far too much time seeking the help, filling out forms, working out insurance, then finding out their websites are out of date, and they don\'t have what I need. I now need therapy to help me recover from looking for therapy. So forget it</li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>Helpers, loved ones, friends, are all well-meaning. In general, I ask myself if the help offered will have a net energizing effect.

And so, I write. It is energizing, knowing that I have some control over how people perceive Mike\'s illness, simply by writing. Oh and for those who want to advise me to "do something for myself," the blog-writing is for myself, and it is life-restoring.</div><div><br /></div><div>In contrast, the professional help community in this country, is not well-meaning, and I\'ve found the effort to not be worth the tradeoff of my energy and peace of mind.

It\'s come to be known as Spoon Theory.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In brief, if you only had twelve spoons per day, and all efforts required one or more spoons, how would you spend them? Keep in mind that if you overspend, then you start tomorrow with fewer.<br /></span><div><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike has a chronic illness. It\'s time for us to think in terms of this pacing, whether we\'re happy about it or not. Nobody is happy about belonging to the Spoon Theory community. But it\'s helpful to know we\'re not alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">This picture was created by&nbsp;Christine Miserando, the originator of Spoon Theory and owner of&nbsp;<a href="https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/" target="_blank">But You Don\'t Look Sick</a></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Her picture is a starting place. If I were to create a Spoon Theory chart specifically for Mike, it would look a little different from the above picture, as Mike is able to work. His limited spoons pertain almost entirely to keeping his business running.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">According to <a href="https://longcovid.physio/" target="_blank">Long Covid Physio</a>, the type of pacing used differs between different health conditions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">As a reminder, his ability to work only partially reflects his "level" of illness. That is, we are in luck that the parts of his brain still functioning well are the problem-solving components, sans any kind of leadership, decision-making, or initiating.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">To the outside world, the practice of Spoon Theory is invisible. Keeping in mind that they do not live in the household, even close family can\'t possibly be cognizant all the time that their loved one is spending spoons at a rapid pace, and will be spoon-depleted or even spoon-negative in the privacy of their own home.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">As it applies to Mike, it\'s mostly just me and our son who can see it. We also have had the privilege of Mike spending extended time with two other people during all this, and they were able to see it too.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Others capable of understanding it, seeing it, or at least believing it, are others who also have been affected personally by the need for Spoon Theory.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And still others who are open to reading and learning can understand it too.&nbsp; Thank you.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And so here\'s where we are at concerning Mike\'s illness, which has somewhat turned a corner into more of a chronic illness and less a Covid-19 illness, even though its source is Covid-19, and we do have to keep that in mind as well, because studies are looking for the unique ways in which Covid-19 affects the brain in these extreme cases.</span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">About Spoon Theory</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Spoon theory is recognized by <a href="https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/features/spoon-theory">WebMD</a>, and applies to:</span></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Dysautonomia</span></li><li><a href="https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/features/spoon-theory"><span style="font-family: arial;">Multiple Sclerosis</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.bjchealth.com.au/blog-fitness/the-spoon-theory-managing-fatigue-with-chronic-illness#:~:text=Spoon%20theory%2C%20uses%20spoons%2C%20as,a%20limited%20number%20of%20spoons."><span style="font-family: arial;">Chronic Fatigue syndrome</span></a></li><li><a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/spoon-theory-chronic-illness/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20spoon%20theory%20is%20a,who%20lives%20with%20chronic%20pain."><span style="font-family: arial;">Chronic Pain</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/spoon-theory-chronic-illness"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lupus</span></a></li><li><a href="https://longcovid.physio/pacing"><span style="font-family: arial;">Long Covid</span></a></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Other illnesses such as cancer, HIV, fibromyalgia,&nbsp; COPD, and heart disease, and other disabilities</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Some other terms</span></h3><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Exertion intolerance</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Exertion limits</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Pacing</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Conserving energy</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Post Exertional Malaise</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And one more thing</span></h3></div></div></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Spoon Theory applies to Caregivers, too</span></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/09/one-step-forward-one-step-back.html', 'title': '22-09-14 A Step Forward, A Step Back', 'content': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9W8d7yDfOlmm07kXGUnFDigamilwcIwK1f0K_cfKECYP54J9Z0DpZGD37K27TMnixguV6rYfs54vQuqa0ui2S-6K3oWMJeFiCaKMmnfFCOgkR1xlfH8Wsc4TQ8VWZ3Y0AYW-s9kstTegneetETfi7q5cn8tT5nOEhF2kWEKpBtHVpZoUCIieZ24CgeQ/s225/optimist.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="225" data-original-width="187" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9W8d7yDfOlmm07kXGUnFDigamilwcIwK1f0K_cfKECYP54J9Z0DpZGD37K27TMnixguV6rYfs54vQuqa0ui2S-6K3oWMJeFiCaKMmnfFCOgkR1xlfH8Wsc4TQ8VWZ3Y0AYW-s9kstTegneetETfi7q5cn8tT5nOEhF2kWEKpBtHVpZoUCIieZ24CgeQ/w266-h320/optimist.png" width="266" /></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;">Long Covid is now being discussed as an auto-immune disease.</span><p></p><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From <a href="https://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/home/news/exploring-the-link-between-covid-19-and-autoimmunity-can-help-patients-with-long-haul-covid/" target="_blank">Rheumatology Advisor</a>: "For many patients, unrelenting fatigue, pain, brain fog, anxiety, and other symptoms linger long after recovery from infection with COVID-19. Regarded as the newest autoimmune-related disorder to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, this condition is being referred to as long-haul COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC)."</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What this means in all practicality:</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s chronic, not acute</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s long-term</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s hard to understand, as the patient can appear from the outside to be functioning, but those short-term public appearances take a heavy toll. So does any decision-making or leadership or trying to laugh</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">The "two steps forward and one step back" characterization, which certainly applies to many conditions, doesn\'t apply well here</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">A way to understand this is that the timeline is so slow that one can notice more granular trends than the common expression "two steps forward, one step back." After all, that\'s lumping two time periods together. Thus what we see from one week to the next, one month to the next, can consist of "one step forward, one step back." And sometimes it\'s the standalone "one step back" with the one step forward coming much later.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">This is hard for the outside world to understand -- even for those who have had illnesses which seemed maddeningly slow. To some extent, then, Long Covid is best understood by folks who\'ve had chronic, long-term auto-immune diseases or disabilities. Or someone close to them who\'ve been open to understanding it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So I need to tell our friends, loved ones, and support team something that may be hard to hear, but here goes -- it\'s almost better to think of Mike\'s illness as semi-permanent, as far as day-to-day living goes. That is, some of his issues might eventually resolve, some might improve somewhat, and some might have to be managed forever.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">That\'s not to say we are disallowing hope. We have to have hope. And we need optimism from those around us. You can even be Pollyannaish if it pleases you. But Mike and I are not being pessimistic. What we\'re doing is adjusting to the pace of this chronic illness. It resolves more slowly than is comfortable for those who love him. We all WANT him to get better sooner than that. We all WANT it to be two steps forward, one step back.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Maybe if you can find it in your heart to accept Mike\'s illness as long-term, and stay with us day-to-day, well...that\'s a special kind of love. If you were to become a quadriplegic, would you want your loved ones to be waiting for you to get better? To become the old you? The analogy is approximate, but there\'s an element of similarity. This is so slow that he needs acceptance as he is.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So yes, we\'re praying for the depression to lift. We\'re praying for the cognitive effects to lift. We\'re getting all the professional help. But regardless, he will never be the old Mike. He\'s already the new Mike. That\'s the only thing I\'m sure about. We are all adjusting to the new Mike.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/09/the-quest-for-learning-about-cbd-and-thc.html', 'title': '22-09-12 Figuring out CBD and THC ', 'content': '<h2 style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizDW7RnxUXXyMqH54HAeq9emp9kfpn9sszbsJXI94ImDPazBP5mgZwaM106SrdBHxSSldyoSyipxqWZXqi_AflpzUBhkcX_Ry28OAGZiBJVU1ti7E3-eVMBXej-WfRuMfJjrMAsmjx9TiNOteY_fLeE_hJx-JXAIxnVZ_fhYyrGSz0V1YHU_vd_ZZ2Dg/s627/chocolate-bar-marijuana-leaf-narcotic-sweets-isolated-vector-illustration-white-background-116677392.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="627" data-original-width="384" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizDW7RnxUXXyMqH54HAeq9emp9kfpn9sszbsJXI94ImDPazBP5mgZwaM106SrdBHxSSldyoSyipxqWZXqi_AflpzUBhkcX_Ry28OAGZiBJVU1ti7E3-eVMBXej-WfRuMfJjrMAsmjx9TiNOteY_fLeE_hJx-JXAIxnVZ_fhYyrGSz0V1YHU_vd_ZZ2Dg/s320/chocolate-bar-marijuana-leaf-narcotic-sweets-isolated-vector-illustration-white-background-116677392.jpg" width="196" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: arial;">What Dr. Parikh suggested we find:&nbsp;</span></div></h2><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dr.&nbsp;Vijal&nbsp;Parikh wants Mike on a 10 to 1 ratio of CBD to THC. Unfortunately, Dr. Parikh\'s hands are tied, as he is licensed to prescribe in New York, but Mike is a New Jersey resident. So we have to figure this out ourselves. He is being understandably careful about not taking the lead on this. But we can ask him questions.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">In New York, THC is by medical prescription only, but in New Jersey, we can get THC recreationally. That sounds good on paper, but those dispensaries are hard to find, and this particular order from the doctor may not be easy to find either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">We already have the THC, so we bought a bottle of CBD tincture. After arranging the right ratio and trying one night, Mike had a severe allergic reaction to the CBD. So now we have even more work to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">We put out a question to the universe and received two possible causes of the allergic reaction. With thanks to a few people and Google, here\'s what we understand so far:</span></p><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><blockquote><li><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;It can be an allergic reaction to the CBD itself. Because it\'s a plant, it could have pollen, thus causing a reaction similar to seasonal allergies, which Mike does have, although they are largely controlled right now by Zertec. Pollen is not likely to be in CBD oil, as CBD is derived from the female plant, which does not have pollen</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">It can be caused by the additives which exist in broad or full spectrum CBD oil. It allows CBD to bind to something (as it does not have its TCH to bind to.) These additives are called terpenes, which exist in broad or full spectrum CBD oil. Examples of terpenes are linalool and D-limonene. Terpene allergies are rare. Sometimes terpenes even get added back to the singular kind, too, to "enhance" the effect.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s more reading: https://royalcbd.com/allergic-reaction-to-cbd-oil/</span></li></blockquote></ol><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Stores, head shops, dispensaries I visited in person:</span></h2><p></p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Name: Redi Recreational Cannabis Store<br />Address: 111 Town Square, Jersey City<br />What I learned: It does not exist.

color: #222222; font-family: arial;">Hi all. If anyone can help us with information about CBD we would appreciate it. We\'ll be consulting with the doctor again about it -- that\'s a given. But in the meantime, if anyone knows anything about CBD allergies, how to avoid them, where and how to find CBD with no additives, we\'d love for someone to either advise us or so some research for us. Just email me privately.</span><p></p><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Meanwhile, we\'re inching along. Although Mike\'s self-report remains a 60 out of 100 for the depression, the PHQ (a more granular survey) shows baby steps of progress.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>The best way to summarize it is that Mike has made mental and cognitive progress, but he doesn\'t "feel" it yet. Dr.&nbsp;</span>Vijal&nbsp;<span>Parikh assured us that this is the typical order of progress. He said many patients don\'t actually "feel" any better until their PHQ is down to 10.</span></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike\'s weekly PHQ scores are descending:</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Two weeks ago: 19</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A week ago: 18</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Yesterday: 15</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If you\'re curious about the PHQ, there\'s a blank one on my blog.</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">We figured out, and Dr. Parikh agrees, that Mike\'s fatigue is a primary symptom of the Long Covid, rather than a component of the depression. He explained to us that Long Covid burns out some neurons. The neurons do regenerate but the timetable for healing is dictated more by the effects of the Long Covid than by a typical timetable for the medication to work.</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thus the depression and fatigue, both the results of Covid, could still take a while to resolve. What\'s more predictable is the order in which the healing is happening. It is just what Dr. Parikh was expecting from a depression patient. We were encouraged by that.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For those of you familiar with depression or who would like to understand it better -- it is very common for the depressed person to harbor self-doubt about their own condition. That had started happening to Mike in the last week, but Dr. Parikh\'s detailed explanation really helped put that to rest.</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Something curious and interesting about this is that the doctor is walking a balancing act all the time between reliance on his own extensive experience with depression patients, and learning in what ways Long Covid\'s effects on the brain are not well understood and could differ from his experience. One seeming contradiction, for example, is that Long Covid requires a great deal of rest, while depression needs to be fought with activity. We are striking a balance as best we can.</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Dr. Parikh is very open to what he doesn\'t know and he keeps learning.</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I\'m getting a picture in my mind now that Mike\'s healing is an upward spiral of one thing affecting another, which is affecting another, which is affecting the first. That is, the Luvox is helping the depression, the depression improvement is helping the Covid brain damage, the mending of the brain is helping his mood, which is helping the Luvox. We still have resting in the mix, but diminished somewhat. By him going back to work, we\'ve now swapped out some of that resting (but not all) and replaced it with him working, which is helping the healing.&nbsp;</span></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/09/the-role-of-thc-edibles.html', 'title': '22-09-04 The Role of THC Edibles', 'content': '<script>var pfHeaderImgUrl = \'\';var pfHeaderTagline = \'\';var pfdisableClickToDel = 0;var pfHideImages = 1;var pfImageDisplayStyle = \'none\';var pfDisablePDF = 1;var pfDisableEmail = 1;var pfDisablePrint = 0;var pfCustomCSS = \'\';var pfBtVersion=\'2\';(function(){var js,pf;pf=document.createElement(\'script\');pf.type=\'text/javascript\';pf.src=\'//cdn.printfriendly.com/printfriendly.js\';document.getElementsByTagName(\'head\')[0].appendChild(pf)})();</script><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzGFlDCY4KhQ7cvwKKmETdcKFwGjzcmttpssDy-j3cPHCEF_h4am4aFkW3xvemhnHaaPCxDxxqsR6oa0_81QSxUX5CkdpWY0y_thAJi1Y-W9dBqK-czFf8WnZ5dt1QbzCaYJdszqD0IdKokv9HeawpuOCxfJFGPoX6_XB7FqV431LrYsMTYsgWxFcL8Q/s820/323-3234828_marijuana-edibles-green-lantern-logo.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="503" data-original-width="820" height="196" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzGFlDCY4KhQ7cvwKKmETdcKFwGjzcmttpssDy-j3cPHCEF_h4am4aFkW3xvemhnHaaPCxDxxqsR6oa0_81QSxUX5CkdpWY0y_thAJi1Y-W9dBqK-czFf8WnZ5dt1QbzCaYJdszqD0IdKokv9HeawpuOCxfJFGPoX6_XB7FqV431LrYsMTYsgWxFcL8Q/s320/323-3234828_marijuana-edibles-green-lantern-logo.png" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />Mike is able to take THC edibles, 20 mg at a time, to plummet the depression from 60 to 0 in the evenings.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">He can take them only when he doesn\'t have work the next day, as they last into mid-morning, leaving him non-functioning.

Our reasoning was that it\'s better than staying home, and it passed time while waiting for the symptoms to resolve. As you all might know by now, through doctor visits, much research, and two attempts at meds with egregious outcomes, the neuropsychiatric symptoms never resolved.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fast forward to August 5 2022 when we started over with a new psychiatrist and new meds. This new psychiatrist agreed about Mike going on those outings, so we continued our city trips.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Some thoughts about our trips:</span></div><div style="color: #222222;"><ol><li style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span face="arial, sans-serif">Mike does not enjoy the trips (he doesn\'t enjoy anything) but they don\'t make his condition worse. Before August, they were slightly better than a "wash." That\'s because before August, while the anxiety was high (and depression lower)</span>&nbsp;he was getting some slight relief from the anxiety from being in motion on the train and while walking. So we had been doing lots of trains and lots of walking.</span></li><li style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Now that the anxiety dropped and the depression rose, being in motion doesn\'t give him any relief at all, but we keep going out because it\'s still better than not doing so.</span></li><li style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sometimes the outings are just to accompany me to work. We travel together, then during my two hour shift, he sits on a bench and reads. We are thankful that he can concentrate on a book.<br /></span></li><li style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When we\'re on an outing, I sometimes take pictures and post them on Facebook. He often smiles for the camera but it doesn\'t mean anything. He\'s an empty shell. I\'ve learned that it is not atypical for depressed persons to look and act "normal." We try to keep that need to a minimum, because "acting normal" takes precious energy, of which he has so little.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="color: black; font-family: arial;">Those smiles do mean something, though. If we get a good feeling from seeing him smile, perhaps that\'s because it offers memories of the past Mike and hopes for the future Mike. It reminds us that Mike is "in there somewhere." So if you\'re inclined to say "but he looks so good," it\'s an interesting dichotomy -- the smile does not reflect his condition, but it does something&nbsp;good and positive for all those who love him. And, in my opinion, that\'s valid!</span></span></li></ol><div><span style="color: black; font-family: arial;">All of you have your own busy lives and full plates. So I can\'t help repeating myself when I thank folks for being on this email list. Whatever amount you want to "take in" is great. Even just having my writings land in your email is good enough to motivate me to write. Writing helps me as his an advocate and researcher.</span></div></div><div><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/08/the-graph.html', 'title': '22-08-31 The Graph', 'content': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuzrzNAZCBOfPG44bpUDel08BHcjKtgDcely6AX7IroJT4J2mhLJLDtbNUqAJ3JvAjf9YfaqPKYdmJItQe02MJZ6VD6JqONo-CtRitIqNQY4BoA1LzYdrqnLLwVWVrwX134qVHXyzWXBTsjkyOr9BfEarPNAtqatcjRR_7_IZ7ZSyfAK8-5x8g-lnoIw/s1650/22-08-31%20Mike\'s%20graph387.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1650" data-original-width="1275" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuzrzNAZCBOfPG44bpUDel08BHcjKtgDcely6AX7IroJT4J2mhLJLDtbNUqAJ3JvAjf9YfaqPKYdmJItQe02MJZ6VD6JqONo-CtRitIqNQY4BoA1LzYdrqnLLwVWVrwX134qVHXyzWXBTsjkyOr9BfEarPNAtqatcjRR_7_IZ7ZSyfAK8-5x8g-lnoIw/w309-h400/22-08-31%20Mike\'s%20graph387.jpg" width="309" /></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;">I started this graph in August, after going back through my written notes from Mike. The bulk of this graph, as you can see on the bottom is August 2022.<br /><br />From January 2022 to August 2022, it was very steady, so there was no need for the graph. The depression was 30 with daily gusts up to 70. There were also a total of three depression gusts to 90. In contrast, the anxiety had been very steady at 90.<br /><br />As you can see, everything changed in August when we got the new doctor and he started some new meds. You will see that the anxiety plummeted, but the depression rose.<br /><br />The scale is based on "patient report." That is, every morning, Mike gives me status of his depression and anxiety, in the form of numbers from 0&nbsp; to 100.<br /><br />We are also writing up the PHQ-9 Questionnaire on a weekly basis. Both assessments serve to inform the doctor of changes, correlations, and patterns.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span><p><br /></p>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/08/letter-to-larger-group-on-august-31.html', 'title': '22-08-31 Returning to work', 'content': '<p><span style="color: #222222;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuG2xl2se3ng8f6jiDVeihvDuj95Qh4zlhsXUUtVl0W_hGA8x7IXHgZZjR_oAd4a_bnxnr90xb1Lwlj2GJ31KiUODwcVj1B6rJCN9Fqj9EEMBr2wtnDEaKt2aJbd9OtDvrptI2oxhdkWwc5W2C1-7ZsISaB0djOBMX91Djz2jnc5RvbbXy4skgPlT8xw/s2000/funny-tired-man-sleeping-his-desk-laptop-after-hard-work-day-office-vector-cartoon_376504-927.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2000" data-original-width="1996" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuG2xl2se3ng8f6jiDVeihvDuj95Qh4zlhsXUUtVl0W_hGA8x7IXHgZZjR_oAd4a_bnxnr90xb1Lwlj2GJ31KiUODwcVj1B6rJCN9Fqj9EEMBr2wtnDEaKt2aJbd9OtDvrptI2oxhdkWwc5W2C1-7ZsISaB0djOBMX91Djz2jnc5RvbbXy4skgPlT8xw/w199-h200/funny-tired-man-sleeping-his-desk-laptop-after-hard-work-day-office-vector-cartoon_376504-927.jpg" width="199" /></a><span style="color: #222222;"></span></div><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial;">Excerpted from the second letter to group:</span><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Hi all. Today is Wednesday. This email list has grown, hence the blind copy. We are really feeling the love. Well okay, I\'m feeling the love. Mike, somewhere inside his spirit, beneath the depression, is registering the love.</span></p><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Anyhow, the last email was on Saturday August 27. It was about how Dr.&nbsp;Vijal&nbsp;Parikh\'s next prescription for Mike was to go back to work, and that\'s not because Mike is all better, but because it was the right time for infusing change. Mike didn\'t have any interest in doing so, but sometimes we have to resort to the good old fashioned "listen to the doc." And besides, my own blink moment told me it was correct.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So here\'s an updated status, which I\'ll write in a list:</span></div><div><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For over a week now, his anxiety has been very steady at a 10 and his depression has been pretty steady at 60. Attached is today\'s graph</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The 20 mg THC edibles do the job of lowering his depression significantly enough to give him relief, but he can\'t get any work done. In fact, if he does them in the evening, he can\'t work the next day. So he\'s still figuring out when he can take the edibles, which might be largely on weekends. (The "figuring out" is a daily task for both of us regarding this illness. We\'re always chasing it.)</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He started work on Sunday, with some nervousness, but through discussion that morning, we were able to identify that the nervousness was of the garden variety --&nbsp; that is, anyone going back to the&nbsp; business they own, in this volatile economy, after being completely out of touch, is going to be a bit nervous. That is, it wasn\'t anxiety. It\'s helpful to tease apart feelings from illness.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He was also nervous and wondering if he would be able to work at all because that relentless depression is like a wall in front of him. When he was working previously through this nightmare (from January through July) he was dealing with a high level of anxiety and a low level of depression. Now they are swapped, so he just had no idea if he could do it. That nervousness too, was not illness-based.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He got through Sunday, but slowly because each new task required new, tiring self-talk to get started. After his workday,&nbsp; he comes out of his office and pours himself into his recliner at the end.&nbsp;There\'s no joy in any part of his day and he has nothing leftover after work. He watches game shows on tv. He\'s an empty shell</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Today is Day Four of work. Today is a little different because he got little sleep last night (first time in a while) and he has to start his workday with a doctor visit to the city. So today will give us a new data point.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s now getting used to the idea that much of his work efforts each day are directed toward his self-talk to make himself get through the day. As for the content of his brain, it seems to be okay, but he has his doubts. He still can reason and problem-solve but he lacks self-confidence now. It\'s all part of the stinkin\' illness.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">We\'re solid now about the reason why the anxiety is down -- it\'s because the Gabapentin is working well. Some patients with anxiety respond to Gabapentin this quickly, so no surprise there. Still no serious side effects.<br /></span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As for the depression, that could still take up to four more weeks, that is, if the Luvox does its job. Still no serious side effects.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If the Luvox doesn\'t do its job, Dr. Parikh has in his head approximately eight more steps (LOL) to try over time. Mike won\'t get dropped as a patient this time.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I\'m guessing because of how taxing it is for him to work, he might be resting all this weekend</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I could keep on writing and writing. So I\'m arbitrarily stopping. I don\'t want to lose my readers with too much prose and lists.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike used to love his job. It\'s his own company; he created it; he hired everyone there. I look forward to the future with hope that he can love his job again. And I look forward to the day when his smiles for the camera, when I\'m dragging him around the city for his mental health, are real.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">All of you have your own full plate. So thanks all for whatever amount you\'re willing or able to digest out of this. It\'s much appreciated.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div></div><div class="yj6qo"></div><div class="adL"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div class="adL"><br style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;" /></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/08/hi-kathy-and-andrew-kathy-youre-still.html', 'title': "22-08-30 Why we're spreading the word", 'content': '<span style="font-family: arial;">This is excerpted from an email to friends:</span><div><div><div><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjulTaNrlR1zgcqqNUFBdRmg1UL7YBClOHv-LjvkRQfcpWuvZmhrbJzh-0SO1zBgPfUv4OIWrWWfynv3_ph5F-FJKtqSFcCqpwB2tYTKRKQarEUrGVLb9egI6e_gkNtZ8q-b6PBJ2zUDpnWylQHp8JCNMVxU41nt2EG2dnpdZl_Wn3vBmJs-Yj8wRxxVA/s400/cartoon-open-shiny-magic-book-concept-with-lights-and-sparkles-vector.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img border="0" data-original-height="200" data-original-width="400" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjulTaNrlR1zgcqqNUFBdRmg1UL7YBClOHv-LjvkRQfcpWuvZmhrbJzh-0SO1zBgPfUv4OIWrWWfynv3_ph5F-FJKtqSFcCqpwB2tYTKRKQarEUrGVLb9egI6e_gkNtZ8q-b6PBJ2zUDpnWylQHp8JCNMVxU41nt2EG2dnpdZl_Wn3vBmJs-Yj8wRxxVA/s320/cartoon-open-shiny-magic-book-concept-with-lights-and-sparkles-vector.jpg" width="320" /></span></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;">We want to be an open book about our journey. I\'m going to list a few reasons why:</span><p></p><div><div><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So little is known about Long Covid, except in small pockets. Even Mike\'s new psychiatrist, who is amazing and who knows Long Covid, is on the leading edge. So we are on the leading edge too. Thus we want to document our journey</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Within Long Covid, our situation represents yet a smaller population, as Mike\'s symptoms are pretty much limited to the neuropsychiatric (depression, anxiety, brain fog, memory loss, suicidal ideations, and some psychosis)</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">We want others to speak freely and to spread the word about the seriousness of Long Covid. Mental health issues need to be out in the open. It might even help someone who currently has neuropsychiatric symptoms, and they don\'t even know it\'s connected to having had Covid. Some of them might have even had silent Covid. We know two such people in our own little circle who, when we described what happened to Mike, had that moment of connecting the dots about their own conditions. So speak freely with others all you want about our journey.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Mike\'s caregiver, I have to keep feeding my mental own health. What seems to keep me stable to a great degree is writing, and being heard and understood</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Mike\'s advocate, every time I write an email update or answer a question, it organizes and fuels my own thinking and research.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><div>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/08/hi-family_30.html', 'title': '22-08-27 About to return to work', 'content': '<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: times; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMz5vkmlKTNA2DDbFgHkE1-CaVvdgdifpMqDDZ2TSgwr9WST5x3mKJe2Qla-LrMKC0aYYi6E0yBrZSG7SXOqSuLDC1pQ6HPHOiEl_hV3SmCcHdfXI6wsAOutfo2CLgWKPdMdsCTUPrujjqSG9S-R2ReiycQLhfXx6j_-6NBurpYU81M_ebsB-x2MzR6g/s800/don-t-want-to-go-to-work-comfy-couch-holding-reluctant-man-who-going-to-work-lockdown-eps-vector-illustration-217860788.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="524" data-original-width="800" height="210" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMz5vkmlKTNA2DDbFgHkE1-CaVvdgdifpMqDDZ2TSgwr9WST5x3mKJe2Qla-LrMKC0aYYi6E0yBrZSG7SXOqSuLDC1pQ6HPHOiEl_hV3SmCcHdfXI6wsAOutfo2CLgWKPdMdsCTUPrujjqSG9S-R2ReiycQLhfXx6j_-6NBurpYU81M_ebsB-x2MzR6g/s320/don-t-want-to-go-to-work-comfy-couch-holding-reluctant-man-who-going-to-work-lockdown-eps-vector-illustration-217860788.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike\'s anxiety has plummeted from a 90 to a 10 and has stayed that way.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">In contrast, and around the same time, the depression, which used to spike from 30 to 70 regularly (and a few times to 90), is now steadily at 60 with spikes to 70. So that means the anxiety went down and the depression baseline went up.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We met with Dr. Parikh on Thursday, expecting he would prescribe yet another medication for the depression, but instead he prescribed going back to work!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So Mike starts work again this Sunday (he has always worked on Sundays so that\'s not weird.)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">By the way, I\'m doing a happy dance right now because the moment Dr.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: black; font-family: arial;">Vijal&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Parikh said it, I knew in my instinctive brain that he was right. And when Mike asked him when that should be, Dr. Parikh said, "umm...tomorrow?" LOL. Mike\'s not doing a happy dance of course, but he\'s following doctor\'s orders. And he took a few more days than Dr. Parikh suggested. He\'ll start tomorrow.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">The reasoning and thoughts all three of us have for Mike going back to work:</span></div><div><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The meds (Gabapentin and Luvox) are doing their job on the anxiety; the depression may take a little longer</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Dr. Parikh now sees this to be a time when not working could start hampering the progress of the meds. Thus, going back to work will be a catalyst to the medication rather than an obstruction</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s only going to work forty hours, instead of his usual seventy, so it\'s definitely a slow start</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s had plenty of rest to help the healing along</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Depression is not a feeling. It\'s something you fight. It\'s time to fight, now that the anxiety is out of the way.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">You might notice a dip in the graph as of this morning. It\'s probably temporary, as last night he added 20 mg of THC edibles, which tends to last into mid-morning. It gave him a much-needed break from the relentlessness of the depression. On the other hand, ya never know!</span></div></div></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Anyway, hope is sustaining us at the moment. Rest assured, he knows to pace himself. Neither of us wants any reversal in his progress. Thanks for continued thoughts and prayers.

Mike wants to be an open book through my writings.</span><p></p><div style="color: #222222;"><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So first...how to think about this...It\'s slow. It requires patience, surrender to its pace, and smelling the roses as best we can.</span></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a recap, in these past few months, his anxiety has been high and steady, while his depression has been medium and spiking. But since August 5, a few things have changed. August 5 is significant because it was his first day out of work on disability, his first day seeing the new doctor, and his first day on the new meds.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s what\'s changed:</span></div><div><ol><li style="background-color: white; margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His anxiety has dropped significantly in the last few days</span></li><li style="background-color: white; margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His depression stopped spiking, but now it\'s much higher steady in the last few days</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: arial;">The psychosis and intrusive thoughts have not returned</span></li><li style="background-color: white; margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His fatigue has increased</span></li><li style="background-color: white; margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He\'s now sleeping fine because he is able to go to bed with less anxiety</span></li></ol><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The rest of this email will be about our surrender to the process. I\'ll make another list:</span></div></div><div style="background-color: white;"><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike\'s illness is called "Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19"</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As of July, it has a diagnosis code&nbsp;</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is still referred to as Long Covid more often than as PASC</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The diagnosis is so new that it\'s not well understood by the medical community, doctors and the world at large</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Long Covid has a mix of over 200 symptoms. including both physical and neuropsychiatric</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The majority of patients with Long Covid got the physical symptoms. Some with physical symptoms also get the neuropsychiatric symptoms. I\'ve met so few people in my research who have had only the psychoneurological symptoms. Those people are especially misunderstood and even maligned by Long Covid support groups. As often happens with special interest groups of all kinds, there\'s been a fracture within the Long Covid community.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s now reported that half of all people who\'ve gotten Omicron (which is what Mike had) never knew they had it. That could explain why there may be a lot of people who now have the psychoneurological symptoms like Mike has, and they don\'t even know it was from Covid. That\'s why they haven\'t joined the online support groups. It\'s self-perpetuating, sadly</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fortunately, we found a top-notch specialist who understands almost all of this. It is unbelievable luck. It\'s Irish luck! LOL. His name is Dr. Vijal Parikh.</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As you can guess by now, this is an isolating illness. I have to keep reaching out to our support team of loved ones and friends to keep you all on board.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What we especially need is to be understood that he\'s not likely to be all better tomorrow. In fact, the timetable for his recovery is unknown.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Dr. Parikh wants Mike to do a combination of lots of rest and getting outside and doing stuff--anything</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thus, when you see pics of him on FB, try not to read anything into whether or not he\'s smiling and its meaning. I know that\'s hard because we all want to see him getting better. I\'ve learned "up close and personal" that an empty shell can smile. On the other hand, I\'ve been reminded by a dear friend that seeing his smile reminds us all that Mike\'s "in there somewhere." That\'s totally valid and reassuring.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">So now, here\'s one more list. This is about Mike\'s cognitive function right now (some of which is part of depression):&nbsp;</span></div></div><div style="background-color: white;"><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He can answer questions about non-emotional data</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He can answer questions which involve complex non-emotional reasoning</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He cannot answer questions that require him to make a decision</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He is lacking in all curiosity</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His memory for these past months is fuzzy</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His affect is flat -- he has no interest in anything but he can fake it when he needs to (such as smiling for the camera or even laughing at a joke)</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He is unmotivated to do anything, but will follow someone else\'s lead. He understands that he needs to go places, but he can\'t plan it himself</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When people see him, they think nothing is wrong. Thus, we strongly need to be believed, and that\'s why I\'m writing this. There\'s no way for anyone to see what\'s going on inside him if they don\'t live with him 24/7.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Maddie was with us all this past week. And so Maddie and Dwight can see it</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I\'m reminded today of just how much I love you guys. How emotionally dependent we are on you and your respective families being in our inner circle. Keep cheering us on, please, regardless of how long this takes. Some folks with Long Covid need two or more years to recover. So in some ways, (but I don\'t mean to overstate this either) we are surrendering to this being our new normal.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This email is a very brief outline, but if you have more questions, please ask. Any time I answer a question, it helps me organize my thinking, which is good because I am still acting in the capacity of Mike\'s advocate and am still researching every day. Too little is known about what Covid (specifically Omicron) is doing to the human brain for us to be able to leave it to doctors to figure out. Dr. Parikh, by the way, is the one who named me as Mike\'s advocate. He knows he needs my input.</span></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I also want to know, how is everybody? We may be in crisis, but it\'s chronic, long-term crisis.

If<br />so, then you know what it’s like to walk through a chronic situation. It can beg a surrender to “whatever<br />time it wants to take.”</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />We are in one now, and it’s medical in nature. We need you all to know that for seven months, Mike has<br />been suffering from a condition called “Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19,” which is a mouthful, but<br />luckily, it’s abbreviated as PASC. This condition is also referred to at times as “Long Haul” or “Long<br />Covid.”</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">It means that weeks or even months after a mild case of Covid (in our case having already been vaxxed<br />and boosted) the former Covid patient is still suffering or even just starts to suffer.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />PASC finally has a diagnosis code, as newly announced by the CDC just last month, and is estimated to<br />be affecting 1 in 13 people in our country, although some estimates are as high as 1 in 5. It spans over<br />200 different symptoms, and of varying severity.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />Mike’s symptoms are neuropsychiatric and severe. You’ve all seen him in church in these past months<br />but what hasn’t been obvious is that he’s an empty shell of his former self. More recently, his condition<br />worsened, but we’re relieved to have finally found a medical expert who understands the condition. We<br />are in good hands, and no longer need help finding resources.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">If you want to help, there are a few ways:<ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Pray for us</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>If you see us in church, you can ask us questions but please take the long view about recovery.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>We might not have progress to report from one week to the next, as this is a slow process. Some</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>folks suffer for as long as two years or more. We are in month eight. Still, it’s nice to be asked</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>how we’re doing, even if we have little new to report</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Do your own research if you want to learn more about it, and spread the word about this illness.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>It is new and not well understood</li></ul><br />You can also contact Linda by text or email to let us know you’re thinking of us.</div><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/08/mikes-mri-for-unrelated-brain-mass.html', 'title': "22-08-16 Mike's MRI for unrelated brain mass", 'content': '<script>var pfHeaderImgUrl = \'\';var pfHeaderTagline = \'\';var pfdisableClickToDel = 0;var pfHideImages = 1;var pfImageDisplayStyle = \'none\';var pfDisablePDF = 1;var pfDisableEmail = 1;var pfDisablePrint = 0;var pfCustomCSS = \'\';var pfBtVersion=\'2\';(function(){var js,pf;pf=document.createElement(\'script\');pf.type=\'text/javascript\';pf.src=\'//cdn.printfriendly.com/printfriendly.js\';document.getElementsByTagName(\'head\')[0].appendChild(pf)})();</script><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnWRDh5Y1e5QtXiQQo0s_1oHRlxCRyiHe2E7Xp2t5gAAF3NuL8RN4pyZF6Lf-TUB1lgOlvO5AlDPXejL5J_mExLy1FjmYpYkNhxkA9am60k3mVzm9aWxvQm9pVuec6yFzGLNUTnTnhcu2lp7APVHPkAJ4TL6D3oelLjk_2H1lFE5gfHQ8c6bMqRfU_jg/s860/700-7002294_photos-of-brain-drawings-clip-art-brain-cartoon.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="665" data-original-width="860" height="247" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnWRDh5Y1e5QtXiQQo0s_1oHRlxCRyiHe2E7Xp2t5gAAF3NuL8RN4pyZF6Lf-TUB1lgOlvO5AlDPXejL5J_mExLy1FjmYpYkNhxkA9am60k3mVzm9aWxvQm9pVuec6yFzGLNUTnTnhcu2lp7APVHPkAJ4TL6D3oelLjk_2H1lFE5gfHQ8c6bMqRfU_jg/s320/700-7002294_photos-of-brain-drawings-clip-art-brain-cartoon.png" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;">This post is back dated to August 16, the day he had yet one more MRI for a condition seemingly unrelated to his Long Covid condition.</span><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Back in November 2018, Mike was diagnosed with a non-malignant brain mass in the frontal lobe.

Mike is not working any more, and the fate of the business is unknown. Mike\'s condition had gotten worse, not better, in July.&nbsp; And so he had to go on disability. He went from impaired to despair. For a week or two, I was looking for in-patient placements in a treatment center. That didn\'t pan out, as they are filled with folks with substance abuse issues, and just the tip of the iceberg of folks who have what Mike has. The covid-specialized treatment centers have year-long waiting lists, and they mostly treat the more physical symptoms.</span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I\'ve learned more than I\'d like about how isolating it is to have a chronic illness. The reason it\'s isolating is because after a while, friends and loved ones tend to fall away in frustration. It\'s human nature to do so. I\'m doing everything I can to prevent that from happening, as we have no timetable.</span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In any case, Mike\'s condition now has a name and a diagnosis code, so I guess we could call that progress (omg).</span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It\'s called&nbsp;Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC). The diagnosis code is&nbsp;ICD-10 code U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified. It was announced by the CDC in July. That\'s how newly emerging this is, and it also helps explain why it\'s been, so far, downplayed, misunderstood, and even denigrated by both the medical community and the general population.</span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #222222; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I\'ve been Mike\'s advocate, Case Manager, companion, social worker, researchist, and therapist.

Moreover, Dr. Patel told Mike:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No SSRI will work</span></li><li style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The severity of the sleep impact caused by the Effexor leads him to be at the end of what he would try and he can\'t in good conscience make another appointment with Mike</span></li><li><span><span style="font-family: arial; white-space: pre-wrap;">He can\'t guess when Mike might get better and said it could be never</span></span></li></ol><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All three assertions have since proved to be faulty, but the damage was already done. As a result of being dropped as a patient, after already having waited months to get this psychiatrist, here\'s what happened:</span></div></div><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike went into despair and hopelessness</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He began having episodes of psychosis</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">He thought he might be too sick to pack up and head home. He got home but is still traumatized by that memory</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">I went into high gear seeking an in-patient or out-patient placement psychiatric placement</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We struck out on both types of placements, with the exception of one, but we still needed a referral from psychiatrist which we didn\'t have -- because he dropped Mike</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">In desperation, we said yes to Mike\'s GP to refer us to a top-notch psychiatrist that does not take insurance. She told us this would take a few days instead of a few months</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike\'s GP did as promised, and we started seeing an outstanding psychiatrist. It\'s like night and day</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">We realized Mike needs to remove all client work, sales and networking, but then he realized he needs to stop work entirely for some time. He went on short-term disability</span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;">Our new doctor, the awesome Dr. Vijal Parikh, rolled up his sleeves and made a plan with multiple ideas to try one at a time. It started with the right meds, and Mike is now, finally, on a path</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: arial;">That first doctor, Dr. Patel, was evil. But he did one thing right -- dropping Mike caused us the acute crisis that led to taking disability leave, getting us the right psychiatrist, and the right meds.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We now understand, up close and personal, that in this country, the good psychiatrists do not take insurance. </span></div></div><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br style="font-size: medium; white-space: normal;" /></div></div></span>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/06/genetic-tests-can-help-find-your.html', 'title': '22-06-13 Genetic Tests for Psych Meds', 'content': '<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjU2eFuAc--DOlxriLcEo-Jyz5KiNSi1zR_55yF2b1Hwv4jO0665wsb3cwyARUOuqubU_MtNNJvjbjD4_-oBQEIyyTXaSeHG6z4V8BrLksOpNwBJHkBXVTvytoUqIbL7Bh7F_c3Moa5jas6uxubfi7vlPqPuh9PlJNV6kooufljwiSQ2bcVC33q7REEIg/s1405/tiny-female-character-carry-huge-human-dna-spiral-model-doctor-conduct-laboratory-genetics-research-medicine-testing-technology-194985613.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1405" data-original-width="1092" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjU2eFuAc--DOlxriLcEo-Jyz5KiNSi1zR_55yF2b1Hwv4jO0665wsb3cwyARUOuqubU_MtNNJvjbjD4_-oBQEIyyTXaSeHG6z4V8BrLksOpNwBJHkBXVTvytoUqIbL7Bh7F_c3Moa5jas6uxubfi7vlPqPuh9PlJNV6kooufljwiSQ2bcVC33q7REEIg/s320/tiny-female-character-carry-huge-human-dna-spiral-model-doctor-conduct-laboratory-genetics-research-medicine-testing-technology-194985613.jpg" width="249" /></a></div><span style="font-family: arial;">This post is written in retrospect, back dated to the day we found out that Mike\'s GP was moving forward with a Genesight test.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">When I first joined a Long Covid social media group, it turned out to be a largely British one. Thank goodness I did, because they were openly discussing some kind of genetic test to help them eliminate psychotropic drugs which would not be compatible with their DNA.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Then I asked around, and learned that in the USA, it\'s called Genesight (or Genomind.) By this time I had switched to a U.S. based Long Covid group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/COVID19survivorcorps">Survivor Corps Facebook Group</a>). I like this group a lot, but they knew nothing about these tests. It\'s another way the Brits are ahead of us. Sad but true.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">This had become a critical issue because the first two meds that Mike tried had such severe side effects that he developed trauma, and the side effects lasted so long that it was clear he could not use those meds.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Had he had the Genesight test, he could avoided months of pain and months of delay in getting better.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We contacted our GP\'s who were open to learning about these new tests. Our practice had to then register as a Genesight clinic before they can order the tests for us. That process took a few weeks, but it proved well worth the wait.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Mike\'s Genesight results showed clearly that the two psychotropic meds he had already tried were a bad idea for his genetic makeup.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">At that time, we still had the first psychologist, who did not make a good recommendation, even with Mike\'s Genesight report in front of him.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">But when we started over with the new, excellent psychiatrist, Dr.&nbsp;Vijal&nbsp;Parikh, he prescribed properly, and was already knowledgeable about Genesight reports.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">I got a Genesight test too, and it was clear from mine why the most conventional SSRI\'s work fine for me. There were few contraindications on my report.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">Here\'s the link to <a href="https://genesight.com/" target="_blank">Genesight</a>.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">And here\'s the link to <a href="https://genomind.com/" target="_blank">Genomind</a>, which is similar.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial;">We found out incidentally that a handful of family members, unbeknownst to us, had used both, with helpful results.

I\'ve back dated it to May 20 because that\'s when I resumed SSRI\'s.<div><br /></div><div>I had been off SSRI\'s for two years before that, but after getting Covid, my anxiety crept back, and got worse than it\'s ever been before.</div><div><br /></div><div>My body\'s experience of anxiety is different from what Mike experiences. For me, it\'s the feeling you get in your stomach when you\'re about to fall. Or at the top of the World Trade Center with no railing at all. Now feel that feeling all day long non-stop. That\'s it! That\'s what I had for months.</div><div><br /></div><div>So by May I was back on SSRI\'s. Happily, I do well on both Celexa and Lexapro, which are commonly&nbsp; prescribed first.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>By June, I was back to myself, and thank goodness for that, because I was consumed by taking care of Mike.<br /><div><br /><div><br /></div></div></div>'}, {'url': 'http://www.longcovidmind.info/2022/04/414-mike-has-non-invasive-brain-surgery.html', 'title': '22-04-14 His non-invasive brain surgery', 'content': '<div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgu7cxN-Zw84dbkiqpTtNImSBS2BQ4ftjUXEax0vAFeBV25hmxJbqzspGae166jYfU-4lRzWgpwRhPXiJumjKD19xIjzSKzNMZ1IkzO5ZA4Y4uFQwbDxQaZaM9L7XbCPb5zP5fvR8liqkzs4zZb9cIgw_XaEhdra2bK5xFxn1Ibi-jkRowPIjlLJj9AxQ/s612/istockphoto-1271438558-612x612.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="306" data-original-width="612" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgu7cxN-Zw84dbkiqpTtNImSBS2BQ4ftjUXEax0vAFeBV25hmxJbqzspGae166jYfU-4lRzWgpwRhPXiJumjKD19xIjzSKzNMZ1IkzO5ZA4Y4uFQwbDxQaZaM9L7XbCPb5zP5fvR8liqkzs4zZb9cIgw_XaEhdra2bK5xFxn1Ibi-jkRowPIjlLJj9AxQ/s320/istockphoto-1271438558-612x612.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>I wrote this post in retrospect.

The fact that Mike had been suffering from Long Covid neurological symptoms did not deter us, as it could take months to reschedule the appointment.</div><div><br /></div><div>His condition was such that his right hand shakiness rendered it almost useless, and his left hand shakiness was getting worse due to his dependence upon it to assist his right hand.</div><div><br /></div><div>He was assured by the surgeon that, although he would get no anesthesia so that he could respond to commands in real time, he would feel no pain.</div><div><br /></div><div>He did feel pain. In addition, the doctor had to work a great deal harder to get it to work. We now know that had Mike not had this particular doctor and instead had some other doctor who "knew" the procedure, the procedure might have failed.</div><div><br /></div><div>As it turns out, the procedure was wildly successful. At the present time, insurance does not cover treatment on the other hand, but Mike doesn\'t even think he will need it because the left hand is now far less pressured to assist the right.</div><div><br /></div><div>We wonder today if the reason he felt pain which was so unusual, had something to do with his existing Long Covid condition. After all, we know that Long Covid causes brain swelling.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is one of those questions we may never have the answer to. But we are thrilled with the results of the Focused Ultrasound. He can now do normal daily tasks.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>'}]
